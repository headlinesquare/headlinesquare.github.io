<p>As the administration marks 100 days in office, President Trump has claimed credit for creating 345,000 jobs [1]. The newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, faces scrutiny for its limited impact on federal spending despite considerable public attention, with reports indicating it has &ldquo;not even scratched the federal budget monster&rdquo; [2]. However, DOGE has identified issues through its new payment verification system while executing multiple high-profile funding cuts during the first 100 days [3].</p>
