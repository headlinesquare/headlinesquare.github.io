<p>President Trump has unveiled plans for a missile defense initiative called the &ldquo;Golden Dome&rdquo; [1], with reported costs ranging from $25 billion [2] to $175 billion over three years [3] to as high as &ldquo;$500 billion&rdquo; [4]. The project has sparked controversy over Elon Musk&rsquo;s involvement, with reports of &ldquo;fury&rdquo; over his bid to build the system [5] and Democratic lawmakers calling for investigations [4].</p>
<p>Internationally, Canada is reportedly discussing joining the program [6] while China has expressed being &ldquo;gravely concerned&rdquo; by the plan [7] and accused the US of &ldquo;turning space into a warzone&rdquo; [8].

<p>President Trump&rsquo;s meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa sparked controversy when Trump confronted Ramaphosa with claims described by multiple media outlets as &ldquo;false&rdquo; [1] and &ldquo;baseless&rdquo; [2] regarding systematic killings of white farmers in South Africa. During what was characterized as a &ldquo;tense&rdquo; meeting [3], Trump reportedly made Ramaphosa watch videos supporting these claims [4] and displayed visuals from the Democratic Republic of Congo as purported evidence of South African &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; [5]. Ramaphosa responded with a pointed reference to Trump&rsquo;s acceptance of a Qatari jet, saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Sorry I Don&rsquo;t Have a Plane to Give You&rdquo; [6].</p>
<p>The meeting was reportedly orchestrated by White House staff [7] and comes amid tensions over U.S. plans to resettle white Afrikaners [8]. Despite the confrontational nature of the exchange, Ramaphosa attempted to pivot the conversation toward trade opportunities between the two nations.</p>
