DAILY BRIEFING
1. Domestic Policy, Crime and Border Security 1.1 Federal Crime Initiatives in Washington, D.C. The Trump administration is executing a major federal crime operation in Washington, D.C., which has so far resulted in 550 arrests along with a significant seizure of illicit guns and drugs [1]. White House reporting on the initiative’s first week indicates that this “federal police control implementation” has coincided with a 22% drop in violent crime in the capital [2]. FBI Director Kash Patel has vowed that the agency will persist with the crime blitz until “every community is safe” [3]. This federal intervention occurs as D.C.’s homicide rate is reported to be over 500% higher than the average U.S. state. Complicating the crime data is a new lawsuit from a D.C. homicide detective alleging that the city’s police department has been deliberately misclassifying deaths as “accidental” to artificially lower its murder statistics [4]. The administration’s direct action has also become a point of media contention, with one report criticizing the New York Times for complaining about the pace of the crime fix just days after one of its reporters allegedly called the crisis “nonexistent” [5].">

<h3 id="11-federal-crime-initiatives-in-washington-dc">1.1 Federal Crime Initiatives in Washington, D.C.</h3>
<p>The Trump administration is executing a major federal crime operation in Washington, D.C., which has so far resulted in 550 arrests along with a significant seizure of illicit guns and drugs [1]. White House reporting on the initiative&rsquo;s first week indicates that this &ldquo;federal police control implementation&rdquo; has coincided with a 22% drop in violent crime in the capital [2]. FBI Director Kash Patel has vowed that the agency will persist with the crime blitz until &ldquo;every community is safe&rdquo; [3]. This federal intervention occurs as D.C.’s homicide rate is reported to be over 500% higher than the average U.S. state. Complicating the crime data is a new lawsuit from a D.C. homicide detective alleging that the city’s police department has been deliberately misclassifying deaths as &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; to artificially lower its murder statistics [4]. The administration&rsquo;s direct action has also become a point of media contention, with one report criticizing the New York Times for complaining about the pace of the crime fix just days after one of its reporters allegedly called the crisis &ldquo;nonexistent&rdquo; [5].</p>

<h3 id="12-immigration-and-border-enforcement">1.2 Immigration and Border Enforcement</h3>
<p>The administration is moving forward with aggressive border security policies on multiple fronts. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has unveiled what is being described as a &ldquo;striking new layer&rdquo; in the administration&rsquo;s border wall strategy [1]. In a parallel action, a federal appeals court has issued a ruling that permits the administration to terminate temporary humanitarian protections for migrants from both Central America and Nepal [2]. These enforcement policies are reportedly drawing strong political criticism.</p>

<h3 id="13-state-and-local-governance-issues">1.3 State and Local Governance Issues</h3>
<p>Several distinct issues are unfolding at the municipal level. In Chicago, the mayor has made it policy that applicants for city flood relief are not required to disclose their immigration status [1]. In New York City, public health officials have identified the cooling towers at Harlem Hospital as the source of a deadly outbreak of Legionnaires&rsquo; disease [2]. Meanwhile, the mayor of Boston reportedly &ldquo;vowed to continue providing sanctuary for illegal rapists,&rdquo; a direct quote from a headline for which no further context was provided [3].</p>

<h3 id="21-intelligence-community-actions">2.1 Intelligence Community Actions</h3>
<p>A significant action has been taken at the highest levels of the U.S. intelligence apparatus. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has revoked the security clearances of 37 former intelligence officials. A report on the matter states a key reason was that the officials &ldquo;abused the public trust&rdquo; in relation to their role in &ldquo;Russiagate,&rdquo; though the specific individuals and their alleged actions were not detailed [1].</p>
<p>[1] Tulsi Yanks Security Clearances Of 37 Intel Officials Over Russiagate: ‘Abused The Public Trust’, <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/tulsi-yanks-security-clearances-of-37-intel-officials-over-russiagate-abused-the-public-trust?topStoryPosition=undefined&amp;author=Tim&#43;Pearce&amp;category=News&amp;elementPosition=1&amp;row=1&amp;rowHeadline=Top&#43;Stories&amp;rowType=Top&#43;Stories&amp;title=Tulsi&#43;Yanks&#43;Security&#43;Clearances&#43;Of&#43;37&#43;Intel&#43;Officials&#43;Over&#43;Russiagate%3A&#43;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">https://www.dailywire.com/news/tulsi-yanks-security-clearances-of-37-intel-officials-over-russiagate-abused-the-public-trust?topStoryPosition=undefined&author=Tim+Pearce&category=News&elementPosition=1&row=1&rowHeadline=Top+Stories&rowType=Top+Stories&title=Tulsi+Yanks+Security+Clearances+Of+37+Intel+Officials+Over+Russiagate%3A+</a>‘Abused+The+Public+Trust’</p>
<h3 id="22-us-foreign-policy-and-diplomatic-actions">2.2 U.S. Foreign Policy and Diplomatic Actions</h3>
<p>The administration is pursuing an assertive and multi-faceted foreign policy. In a move to counter cartel activity, U.S. warships have been deployed to patrol international waters near Venezuela [1]. Simultaneously, the administration has escalated its confrontation with the International Criminal Court by imposing new sanctions on its officials [2]. On the diplomatic front, a recent White House summit on the war in Ukraine was characterized by one European outlet as a &ldquo;humiliation for Europe&rdquo; [3]. In a separate and unusual report, 70,000 monks are said to have thanked President Trump &ldquo;for ending the war,&rdquo; though the specific conflict is not named [4].</p>
