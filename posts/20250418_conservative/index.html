Meanwhile, former President Biden has reportedly set his speaking fee at $300,000, with additional requirements for private jet travel and staff expenses [4], though reports suggest he is struggling to secure engagements at this price [4].

<p>The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia has gained significant attention after his deportation to El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele confirmed he would remain in custody [1]. Democratic Senator Van Hollen met with Garcia in El Salvador [2], with reports suggesting the meeting produced photographs that undermined certain political narratives [3]. In judicial developments, a liberal Supreme Court Justice declined to intervene in the deportation of migrants claiming to flee cartel violence [4]. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations have continued with varied outcomes: agents in Miami arrested a member of Cuba&rsquo;s Communist Party [5], while in New Jersey, an enforcement action resulted in an ICE officer suffering a broken nose, with the suspect now facing up to 20 years imprisonment [6].</p>
