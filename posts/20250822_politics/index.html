DAILY BRIEFING
1. Executive Power &amp; National Security 1.1. FBI Searches Former NSA John Bolton; DIA Chief Fired in “Purge” Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies were at the center of a series of high-stakes actions targeting current and former officials. The FBI conducted searches of the Maryland home and office of John Bolton, former National Security Advisor and a prominent critic of President Trump, as part of a “resumed national security investigation” [1]. According to reports, the search occurred just hours after Bolton had publicly criticized the President on CNN [2]. In response, President Trump called his former aide a “lowlife” and “a very unpatriotic guy,” while Vice President JD Vance later stated that the investigation was not a result of Bolton’s political criticism [3, 4].">

<p>Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies were at the center of a series of high-stakes actions targeting current and former officials. The FBI conducted searches of the Maryland home and office of John Bolton, former National Security Advisor and a prominent critic of President Trump, as part of a &ldquo;resumed national security investigation&rdquo; [1]. According to reports, the search occurred just hours after Bolton had publicly criticized the President on CNN [2]. In response, President Trump called his former aide a &ldquo;lowlife&rdquo; and &ldquo;a very unpatriotic guy,&rdquo; while Vice President JD Vance later stated that the investigation was not a result of Bolton&rsquo;s political criticism [3, 4].</p>
<p>In a parallel major development, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has fired Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) [5]. The move is described in reports as the &ldquo;latest purge,&rdquo; with the firing reportedly linked directly to a DIA intelligence assessment on damage from Iranian strikes that was said to have &ldquo;angered Trump&rdquo; [6]. Separately, it was reported that &ldquo;one of the CIA’s most senior Russia analysts&rdquo; has also been purged from that agency [7].</p>

<h3 id="12-trump-threatens-military-deployment-in-chicago-new-york-after-arming-dc-guard">1.2. Trump Threatens Military Deployment in Chicago, New York After Arming D.C. Guard</h3>
<p>The Trump administration is escalating its federal intervention into U.S. city governance. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has formally authorized National Guard troops deployed in Washington, D.C. to carry service weapons, an order that came as President Trump visited the troops to praise the ongoing &ldquo;military crackdown&rdquo; on crime [1, 2].</p>
<p>Following the D.C. action, President Trump publicly announced his intention to expand this model, threatening to deploy the &ldquo;regular military&rdquo; to &ldquo;straighten it out&rdquo; in Chicago and adding that New York City &ldquo;is after that&rdquo; [3]. The strategic justification has been questioned in some reports, with one noting that GOP governors sending state troops to support the D.C. operation have &ldquo;10 cities with higher crime rates&rdquo; in their own states [4].</p>

<p>The Department of Justice made a significant move in the Jeffrey Epstein case by publicly releasing the full audio and transcripts of its interview with Ghislaine Maxwell [1]. In the testimony, Maxwell denied any knowledge of an Epstein client list and provided no &ldquo;incriminating information&rdquo; on high-profile individuals [2]. While reportedly pursuing a presidential pardon, Maxwell stated she never saw President Trump &ldquo;in any inappropriate setting&rdquo; [3].</p>
<p>This release comes as the House Oversight Committee begins its review of the &ldquo;first wave of Epstein files&rdquo; sent from the DOJ [4]. President Trump commented on the matter, stating that he told Attorney General Pam Bondi to &ldquo;&lsquo;Give Them Everything&rsquo;&rdquo; and that some people are in the files who &ldquo;don&rsquo;t deserve to be&rdquo; [5].</p>

<h3 id="22-challenges-to-doj-appointments-and-investigations">2.2. Challenges to DOJ Appointments and Investigations</h3>
<p>The Department of Justice under Attorney General Pam Bondi is facing significant judicial and internal challenges. A federal judge ruled that Alina Habba, identified as &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s top federal prosecutor in New Jersey,&rdquo; is &ldquo;unlawfully serving&rdquo; and was not lawfully appointed to her post [1]. Separately, the DOJ has hired a new lawyer who previously drew public criticism for having &ldquo;compared Jan. 6 prosecutions to the Holocaust&rdquo; [2]. These developments occur amid commentary alleging that &ldquo;Trump’s DOJ is going after his enemies,&rdquo; following a public denunciation of what one fired Trump appointee called Bondi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Corrupt DOJ&rdquo; [3, 4].</p>

<p>Two major announcements have jolted the U.S. economic landscape. President Trump has stated that an agreement has been reached for the U.S. government to acquire a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel Corporation, a move that sent the company&rsquo;s stock higher [1]. Details of the deal have not been publicly confirmed by Intel.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell issued a stark warning that the economy is in a worse position than previously understood, revealing the U.S. jobs market is experiencing a &ldquo;much larger&rdquo; slowdown than initial data indicated [2]. This follows an earlier signal that the Fed may cut interest rates soon, even as inflation risks persist [3]. A related report cautioned that political interference with the Bureau of Labor Statistics could compromise the reliability of essential economic data [4].</p>

<h3 id="32-trade--tariff-developments">3.2. Trade &amp; Tariff Developments</h3>
<p>On international trade, the Canadian government announced it is scrapping billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports in a move widely seen as an &ldquo;olive branch&rdquo; to the Trump administration [1]. Meanwhile, President Trump has signaled that new tariffs on furniture are &ldquo;coming later this year,&rdquo; though no specific countries or rates were mentioned [2]. The economic impact of existing tariffs continues to be felt, with retail giant Walmart reporting that its costs are &ldquo;rising &rsquo;each week&rsquo; and will continue&rdquo; to do so [3].</p>

<p>The administration has initiated a massive immigration enforcement and vetting operation, announcing a review of all 55 million active U.S. visa holders to identify deportable offenses in a &ldquo;growing crackdown&rdquo; [1]. The U.S. has also halted the issuance of all worker visas for commercial truck drivers, a move met with concern from an industry that relies on foreign labor [2]. On the enforcement front, a federal judge ordered the complete closure of a Florida detention center known as &ldquo;Alligator Alcatraz,&rdquo; though Governor Ron DeSantis stated the ruling will not frustrate state deportation efforts [3, 4]. These actions have sparked local resistance, with El Paso reportedly opposing a large new detention facility and polling suggesting ICE raids may be &ldquo;backfiring in California&rdquo; [5].</p>

<p>A high-stakes battle over congressional redistricting is escalating between the nation&rsquo;s two most populous states. In a direct counter to a new GOP-drawn map in Texas, California&rsquo;s legislature and Governor Gavin Newsom approved an aggressively gerrymandered plan of their own, which will now go before voters in a November ballot measure [1]. The competing moves have set up a direct confrontation that one analysis suggests could disrupt the &ldquo;rare partisan balance&rdquo; in the U.S. House of Representatives [2].</p>

<h3 id="43-clashes-over-social-policy--presidential-rhetoric">4.3. Clashes Over Social Policy &amp; Presidential Rhetoric</h3>
<p>The administration&rsquo;s actions and rhetoric are fueling cultural and social conflicts. President Trump escalated attacks on Smithsonian museums, claiming there is too much focus on &ldquo;how bad slavery was&rdquo; [1]. In a symbolic flashpoint in Florida, a Pulse Memorial rainbow crosswalk was painted over on what reports claim were &ldquo;Trump’s orders,&rdquo; an act defied by locals who restored it [2]. The Department of Education has revoked guidance for English language learning services, while the DOJ has declined to defend the constitutionality of federal grants for Hispanic-serving colleges [3, 4]. A grave report also alleges that after the former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) targeted an individual on social media, that person&rsquo;s family was subsequently taken by the Taliban, though specifics were not detailed [5].</p>

<p>The administration&rsquo;s approach to the war in Ukraine is reportedly causing significant friction with European allies. While Secretary of State Marco Rubio affirmed a pledge to back security guarantees for Ukraine, he emphasized that Europe &ldquo;must lead&rdquo; [1]. This stance, coupled with President Trump’s suggestion that Ukraine &ldquo;play offensive,&rdquo; has fostered skepticism, with the EU’s top diplomat claiming Russian President Vladimir Putin is &ldquo;laughing&rdquo; at U.S. peace efforts [2, 3]. One analysis concludes that Russia&rsquo;s actions have &ldquo;killed Trump&rsquo;s Ukraine plan,&rdquo; positioning Putin as the &ldquo;real dealmaker&rdquo; [4].</p>

<h3 id="52-internal-party-tensions-and-electoral-positioning">5.2. Internal Party Tensions and Electoral Positioning</h3>
<p>Both major parties are navigating internal divisions and strategic challenges. Within the Democratic party, progressive groups are backing a DNC resolution calling for an arms embargo on Israel and recognition of a Palestinian state, highlighting a major fault line [1]. This is creating public confrontations, such as when pro-Palestinian activists derailed a House Democrat&rsquo;s town hall [2]. Simultaneously, some party strategists are circulating lists of terms to avoid to stop &ldquo;Sounding Like ‘Crazy People’&rdquo; [3]. On the Republican side, Rep. Chip Roy and several others have departed the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus in a move that reports say &ldquo;could transform House GOP&rdquo; politics [4]. In a key state-level race, Roy has announced he will challenge Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton [5].</p>
