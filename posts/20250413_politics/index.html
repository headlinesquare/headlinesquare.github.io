<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, faces significant challenges with the New York Times reporting DOGE is &ldquo;far short of its goal&rdquo; and &ldquo;still overstating its progress&rdquo; [1]. Musk has dramatically reduced DOGE&rsquo;s annual savings target from $2 trillion to $150 billion [2]. A judge has relaxed restrictions on DOGE&rsquo;s access to sensitive Treasury information [3], while The Daily Beast reports &ldquo;DOGE Goons Physically Drag Social Security Worker From Desk&rdquo; [4].</p>

<p>The White House has released President Trump&rsquo;s annual physical exam results, with his physician declaring him in &ldquo;excellent health&rdquo; [1]. Rolling Stone notes unusual elements in the assessment, including the doctor citing &ldquo;frequent victories in golf&rdquo; as evidence of good health [2]. After a week of market turmoil, Trump attended a UFC event in Miami [3]. Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon told Bill Maher that &ldquo;Trump is going to run for a third term&rdquo; [4], which would conflict with constitutional term limits.</p>

<h3 id="21-deportation-controversies-and-legal-challenges">2.1 Deportation Controversies and Legal Challenges</h3>
<p>The Trump administration faces scrutiny over deportation cases. Officials claim wrongfully deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia is &ldquo;alive and detained&rdquo; in El Salvador&rsquo;s prison system [1], but the administration &ldquo;contends it has no duty to return illegally deported man to US&rdquo; [2]. Lawyers for Abrego Garcia have requested a U.S. contempt hearing [3]. Senator Rubio states that &ldquo;another 10 people have been sent to El Salvador&rdquo; [4]. Separately, a U.S. citizen reportedly received instructions from DHS to &ldquo;immediately self-deport&rdquo; [5].</p>

<p>President Trump has given military jurisdiction over federal land at the U.S.-Mexico border [1]. Trump aides have directed the Social Security Administration to list more than 6,000 living immigrants as dead [2], effectively turning Social Security into an immigration enforcement tool [3].

<p>The Trump administration&rsquo;s tariff policy has experienced significant volatility. After promising &ldquo;no retreat on tariffs,&rdquo; Trump subsequently yielded on some measures [1], with the Wall Street Journal explaining &ldquo;why Trump blinked on tariffs just hours after they went into effect&rdquo; [2]. Commerce Secretary Lutnick announced exempted electronic products will come under separate tariffs [3]. One Minnesota company saw tariff costs jump from $18,000 to $170,000 on a shipment from China [4]. Republican lawmakers fear political consequences [5], with an Iowa State economist warning: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going to be poorer&rdquo; [6].</p>
