<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth faces escalating scrutiny over security breaches involving classified information. Reports indicate he shared sensitive Yemen military operations in a &ldquo;second Signal chat&rdquo; with his wife, brother, and lawyer [1][2], weeks after a previous security scandal. The shared information reportedly included &ldquo;airstrikes timings&rdquo; [3], potentially compromising operational security. Former Pentagon officials describe a &ldquo;meltdown&rdquo; [4] and &ldquo;total chaos&rdquo; [5] under Hegseth&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
<p>President Trump has defended Hegseth, offering private reassurance [6] and publicly stating he&rsquo;s doing a &ldquo;phenomenal job&rdquo; [7]. However, bipartisan criticism is mounting, with Republican Representative Don Bacon calling for Hegseth&rsquo;s removal, describing him as &ldquo;an amateur person&rdquo; [8], and Senator Duckworth accusing him of endangering troops with &ldquo;singular stupidity&rdquo; [9]. Reports suggest the White House has initiated the process of searching for a new Secretary of Defense [10], though administration officials deny these claims as &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; [11].</p>

<h3 id="21-federal-reserve-confrontation">2.1 Federal Reserve Confrontation</h3>
<p>President Trump has escalated his confrontation with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, explicitly demanding immediate interest rate cuts and labeling Powell a &ldquo;loser&rdquo; [1]. The President has warned of an economic slowdown unless the Fed lowers rates [2], creating unprecedented tension between the White House and the central bank. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee has responded by emphasizing that Federal Reserve independence is &ldquo;critically important&rdquo; for its inflation fight [3].</p>
<p>This confrontation has had immediate market consequences, with stocks and the dollar declining [4]. The U.S. dollar has fallen to a three-year low amid investor concerns [5], while gold has surged &ldquo;to a record above $3,400&rdquo; as &ldquo;Trump threatens Fed independence&rdquo; [6].</p>

<h3 id="22-trade-wars--business-impacts">2.2 Trade Wars &amp; Business Impacts</h3>
<p>The administration&rsquo;s tariff policies are generating significant business concerns. President Trump is scheduled to meet with executives from major retailers Walmart, Target, and Home Depot to discuss tariff policies [1] as &ldquo;tariff angst spreads.&rdquo; The Wall Street Journal reports that &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s Trade War Threatens One of America&rsquo;s Top Energy Exports&rdquo; [2], while trade negotiations with Japan have stalled [3].</p>
<p>Concrete business impacts include &ldquo;China sends back new Boeing jet made more expensive by tariffs&rdquo; [4], while manufacturing has been affected, with Mack Trucks announcing layoffs of up to 350 workers, citing tariffs among the factors [5]. Financial experts warn that continued tariffs could trigger a recession and significant retail bankruptcies [6].</p>
