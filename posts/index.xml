<h3 id="11-constitutional-statements-and-powers">1.1 Constitutional Statements and Powers</h3>

The New York Times reports that intellectual foundations are &ldquo;setting the stage for Trump the All-Powerful&rdquo; [3], while analysts suggest his next 100 days will make his already consequential first 100 days &ldquo;look tranquil&rdquo; [4].</p>]]></description>
