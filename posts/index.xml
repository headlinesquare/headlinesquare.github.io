<h3 id="11-presidential-executive-orders--directives">1.1 Presidential Executive Orders &amp; Directives</h3>
<p>President Trump has issued several significant executive orders, including terminating federal funding for NPR and PBS, entities he accused of spreading &ldquo;radical, woke propaganda disguised as news&rdquo; [1] [2]. PBS and NPR leadership have characterized this order as &ldquo;unlawful,&rdquo; asserting the president lacks authority to defund these organizations [3]. Trump has also stated he will revoke Harvard University&rsquo;s tax-exempt status [4] and has proposed renaming Veterans Day to &ldquo;Victory Day for World War I&rdquo; [5]. The administration is implementing changes through the energy department to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico [6]. Resistance to these orders has emerged, as evidenced by leaked audio from an Illinois medical school administrator outlining plans to defy Trump&rsquo;s executive orders, characterizing them as an &ldquo;attack on women&rdquo; and &ldquo;attack on human rights&rdquo; [7].</p>]]></description>

President Trump has offered Waltz a new position as UN Ambassador while naming Senator Marco Rubio as the new National Security Adviser [3]. The scandal reportedly involves Waltz accidentally revealing an app the government uses to archive Signal messages [4], with the Pentagon Inspector General expanding its investigation into Signal usage by officials [5].</p>]]></description>

<p>President Trump marked his first 100 days with rallies and interviews amid declining polling numbers [1][2].

Multiple polls show Trump with the &ldquo;worst 100-day polling ever&rdquo; [5] and indicate voters are &ldquo;souring&rdquo; on his performance, particularly in Georgia where economic fears are rising [2]. PBS analysis indicates Trump has reshaped federal operations in three major areas [6], while Democrats formally rallied at the Capitol to condemn what they characterize as a failed start [7].</p>]]></description>

<h3 id="11-first-100-days-assessment">1.1 First 100 Days Assessment</h3>
<p>President Trump marked his first 100 days with a Michigan rally where he defended tariff policies and Musk-led government reorganization [1], claiming his administration achieved the &ldquo;most successful&rdquo; first 100 days in presidential history [2]. Public opinion appears mixed, with some Americans rating this period &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; while others believe changes are happening &ldquo;too fast&rdquo; [3]. The White House released a document listing &ldquo;dozens of hoaxes&rdquo; pushed by media during this period [4]. Media interactions have been contentious, with Trump bluntly telling ABC reporter Terry Moran &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust you&rdquo; during a &ldquo;fiery&rdquo; interview [5]. Vice President Vance described Trump&rsquo;s leadership as &ldquo;empowering&rdquo; and fostering &ldquo;trust&rdquo; while reducing internal &ldquo;turf battles&rdquo; [6].</p>]]></description>

Financial markets are experiencing their worst 100-day start since Nixon due to &ldquo;semi-permanent uncertainty&rdquo; [5].</p>]]></description>

<p>President Trump has made expansive claims about his authority, stating in an Atlantic interview, &ldquo;I run the country and the world&rdquo; [1] [2]. This assertion comes amid declining poll numbers showing his approval rating slipping to 41% after nearly 100 days [3], prompting him to &ldquo;lash out against &lsquo;fake polls&rsquo;&rdquo; [4] and reportedly demand investigations into unfavorable polling data [5]. During Vatican talks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, Trump described him as &ldquo;calmer&rdquo; [6] and later suggested he believes Zelenskyy may be willing to cede Crimea to Russia [7]. Presidential directives now include plans to sign executive orders mandating truckers speak English [8] and requiring creation of a &ldquo;nationwide list of sanctuary cities and states&rdquo; [9].</p>]]></description>
