<p>As President Trump&rsquo;s administration reaches its first 100 days, polling data indicates historically low approval ratings. CNN reports Trump&rsquo;s approval is lower than any president in at least seven decades [1]. The Washington Post notes Trump&rsquo;s approval is sinking as Americans criticize his major policies [2]. Even among Republicans, support is limited, with only about half saying Trump has focused on the right priorities [3]. The New Yorker has characterized this period as &ldquo;One Hundred Days of Ineptitude&rdquo; [4], while the administration is actively dismissing economic concerns as the 100-day milestone approaches [5].</p>]]></description>
