In a significant address to the U.S. Army Academy&rsquo;s graduating class of 2025 [3], President Trump stated that &ldquo;The job of the US Armed Forces is not to host drag shows, to change foreign cultures, or to spread democracy &hellip; at the point of a gun&rdquo; [4]. The White House has highlighted economic improvements, announcing the &ldquo;lowest Memorial Day weekend prices since 2021,&rdquo; attributed to what one source calls &ldquo;The Trump Effect&rdquo; [5].</p>]]></description>
