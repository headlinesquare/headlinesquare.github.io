<h3 id="11-russia-ukraine-conflict-and-us-russia-diplomacy">1.1 Russia-Ukraine Conflict and U.S.-Russia Diplomacy</h3>
<p>President Trump has intensified diplomatic efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine conflict, engaging in what The Hill described as a &ldquo;critical phone call with Putin&rdquo; [1]. Following these discussions, Bloomberg reports Trump announced Ukraine and Russia would &ldquo;start ceasefire talks immediately&rdquo; [2], though notably these talks will involve only the two warring nations without U.S. mediation. This development comes amid what The Times reports as &ldquo;the biggest wave of drone strikes on Ukraine,&rdquo; characterized as a direct taunt to President Trump [3]. The Guardian notes &ldquo;Donald Trump is losing patience with Russia, says Finnish leader&rdquo; [4], suggesting growing frustration within the administration over Putin&rsquo;s continued aggression despite diplomatic outreach.</p>]]></description>
