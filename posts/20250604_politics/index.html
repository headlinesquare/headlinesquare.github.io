<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s departure from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been complicated by his public condemnation of the administration&rsquo;s tax legislation, describing it as a &ldquo;disgusting abomination&rdquo; [1]. This criticism reportedly caught White House officials off guard [2] and left President Trump &ldquo;furious&rdquo; [3]. Speaker Mike Johnson was allegedly &ldquo;ghosted&rdquo; by Musk after Musk threatened to &ldquo;fire them all in the midterms&rdquo; [4].</p>
<p>Russell Vought is positioned to take over DOGE leadership [5]. Experts warn DOGE&rsquo;s data collection efforts could undermine the reliability of future U.S. government statistics [6]. Congressional scrutiny has emerged, with Representative Stephen Lynch inquiring whether Musk was under the influence of substances during his government work [7].</p>

<h3 id="12-federal-budget-and-big-beautiful-bill">1.2 Federal Budget and &ldquo;Big Beautiful Bill&rdquo;</h3>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office analysis of the Trump administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;Big Beautiful Bill&rdquo; reveals it would add $2.4 trillion to the federal deficit while cutting taxes by $3.7 trillion [1]. Healthcare impacts are projected to be significant, with 10.9 million Americans potentially losing health insurance coverage [2].</p>
<p>Opposition within Republican ranks has materialized, with Senator Rand Paul refusing to support what he called &ldquo;a $5T increase to our deficit&rdquo; [3], and Senator Ron Johnson criticizing the bill as &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; [4]. President Trump has called for eliminating the debt limit altogether [5].</p>

<h3 id="13-federal-workforce-and-agency-reforms">1.3 Federal Workforce and Agency Reforms</h3>
<p>The White House has outlined plans to eliminate 107,000 federal jobs in the upcoming fiscal year [1], contrasting with private sector hiring rising by only 37,000 in May—the lowest increase in more than two years [2]. The administration has renamed the AI Safety Institute to the &ldquo;Center for AI Standards and Innovation,&rdquo; removing the word &ldquo;safety&rdquo; from its title [3].</p>
<p>Meteorologist John Morales has warned that funding cuts to NOAA will negatively impact hurricane prediction accuracy [4]. The Kennedy Center is experiencing a dramatic decline in ticket sales coinciding with what is described as a Trump intervention [5].</p>

<h3 id="21-tariffs-and-international-trade">2.1 Tariffs and International Trade</h3>
<p>The Trump administration&rsquo;s tariffs on steel and aluminum have taken effect, doubling previous rates [1]. North Carolina manufacturers have expressed concerns about their ability to remain competitive under the increased costs [2], while Canadian officials are engaged in &ldquo;intensive discussions&rdquo; with the U.S. following what they characterized as a &ldquo;tariff punch&rdquo; [3].</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office has analyzed President Trump&rsquo;s proposed tariff policies, projecting they would reduce U.S. deficits by $2.8 trillion over ten years while simultaneously shrinking the economy [4]. Businesses are raising prices on products in response to the tariffs, including on goods not directly affected by the import duties [5]. The administration has threatened to withdraw $4 billion from California&rsquo;s high-speed rail project [6].</p>
