<p>The Trump administration&rsquo;s first 100 days have been marked by significant federal workforce reductions [1]. The largest federal employee union has shed more than half its staff amid what CNN terms &ldquo;Trump attacks&rdquo; [2]. These cuts have particularly destabilized the Black middle class, for whom federal employment has been a crucial economic pathway [3]. Many federal employees have discovered they no longer have health insurance despite being told otherwise [4].</p>

<h3 id="21-doge-operations-and-budget-controversies">2.1 Doge Operations and Budget Controversies</h3>
<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, claims to have saved $160 billion through budget cuts. However, an analysis indicates these same cuts have actually cost taxpayers approximately $135 billion [1]. Musk&rsquo;s leadership of DOGE is being characterized as &ldquo;tech-bro Maoism&rdquo; that has historically led to negative outcomes [2]. The Pentagon has prepared briefings for Musk on top secret U.S. weapons for a potential China conflict [3], indicating his expanded access to classified military information. Musk&rsquo;s dual role as DOGE head and Tesla CEO has created potential regulatory tensions, with New York state considering action to close Tesla dealerships [4].</p>
<p>[1] DOGE says it has saved $160 billion.

<h3 id="22-musks-public-perception">2.2 Musk&rsquo;s Public Perception</h3>
<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s public perception has deteriorated as his government influence has grown. Associated Press reporting indicates Musk is now unpopular, with most Americans believing he has too much influence in Washington [1]. An AP-NORC poll confirms his popularity has fallen as he gained power [2]. Even previous supporters are distancing themselves, with one business owner who once &ldquo;worshipped&rdquo; Musk now making changes to his Musk Construction company [3].</p>

<p>A major controversy has erupted over U.S. citizen children being deported. The Washington Post reports three American citizens, ages 2, 4, and 7, were swiftly deported from Louisiana [1]. A federal judge stated that a 2-year-old U.S. citizen may have been deported without &ldquo;meaningful process&rdquo; [2]. The New York Times reports that American children, including &ldquo;a 4-year-old with cancer,&rdquo; were sent to Honduras with their undocumented mothers [3]. Administration officials have offered contradictory responses – the Border Czar maintains &ldquo;no U.S. citizen child was deported&rdquo; while acknowledging children were removed with their mothers [4], and Secretary of State Rubio has defended the actions by stating &ldquo;they can come back&rdquo; [5].</p>

<p>Immigration enforcement has intensified with large-scale operations across multiple states. The New York Times reports &ldquo;ICE Arrests Nearly 800 in Florida in Operation With Local Officers&rdquo; [1], while Fox News characterizes the same operation as a &ldquo;Tidal Wave&rdquo; [2]. In Colorado, &ldquo;over 100 migrants in the US illegally&rdquo; were arrested at what&rsquo;s described as &ldquo;an illegal after-hours nightclub&rdquo; [3]. Even those connected to military personnel have faced enforcement actions, with the wife of a U.S. Coast Guard member arrested over an expired visa during a security check for military housing [4].</p>

<h3 id="41-tariffs-and-trade-relations">4.1 Tariffs and Trade Relations</h3>
<p>The administration&rsquo;s tariff policies are generating significant economic consequences and cabinet disagreements. Trump is floating new income tax cuts specifically to &ldquo;ease the bite of tariffs&rdquo; [1], suggesting acknowledgment that tariffs are creating economic pressure. Reuters reports that &ldquo;Trump cabinet members clash on tariff talks with China&rdquo; [2]. Tangible impacts include reports that &ldquo;a major car manufacturer says it will stop production of this vehicle due to tariffs&rdquo; [3] and consumer goods seeing price increases, as &ldquo;Shein, Temu prices go up today&rdquo; [4]. Consumer sentiment has fallen to its lowest level since the postpandemic inflation peak [5], and despite campaign promises to lower food prices on &ldquo;Day 1,&rdquo; food prices have increased 99 days into the administration [6].</p>

<p>Federal courts have issued multiple rulings blocking key executive actions. A judge has blocked a Trump executive order that strips union rights from federal workers [1]. Judges have also blocked the administration&rsquo;s crackdown on school diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs [2]. These judicial checks have prompted responses from President Trump, who &ldquo;rages at judges&rdquo; following a deportation setback while claiming &ldquo;no retribution&rdquo; [3].
