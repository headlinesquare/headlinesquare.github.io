<p>President Trump is expanding executive authority by placing more federal civil servants directly under presidential control [1] and implementing Schedule F to make it easier to fire approximately 50,000 workers by removing civil service protections [2]. A judge has extended a ban on Musk&rsquo;s DOGE accessing private Social Security information [3], while law firms, universities, and civil society groups have become targets for &ldquo;punitive action&rdquo; [4]. The IRS faces leadership turmoil, with the head reportedly being ousted amid a power struggle between Treasury and Elon Musk [5]. Federal employees are experiencing mental health issues amid termination waves, with some establishing a &ldquo;Muskville&rdquo; encampment in Washington D.C. [6].</p>

<p>The Trump administration&rsquo;s deportation initiatives face significant legal opposition.

Van Hollen revealed El Salvador&rsquo;s government staged elements of their meeting, stating &ldquo;nobody drank any margaritas&rdquo; [3]. The White House has dismissed concerns, boasting that Abrego Garcia is &ldquo;never coming back&rdquo; [4], while President Trump attacked Van Hollen as a &ldquo;grandstander&rdquo; who &ldquo;looked like a fool&rdquo; [5].</p>
