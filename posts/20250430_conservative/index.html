<p>President Trump marked his first 100 days with a Michigan rally where he defended tariff policies and Musk-led government reorganization [1], claiming his administration achieved the &ldquo;most successful&rdquo; first 100 days in presidential history [2]. Public opinion appears mixed, with some Americans rating this period &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; while others believe changes are happening &ldquo;too fast&rdquo; [3]. The White House released a document listing &ldquo;dozens of hoaxes&rdquo; pushed by media during this period [4]. Media interactions have been contentious, with Trump bluntly telling ABC reporter Terry Moran &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust you&rdquo; during a &ldquo;fiery&rdquo; interview [5]. Vice President Vance described Trump&rsquo;s leadership as &ldquo;empowering&rdquo; and fostering &ldquo;trust&rdquo; while reducing internal &ldquo;turf battles&rdquo; [6].</p>

<h3 id="12-executive-actions-and-cabinet-activities">1.2 Executive Actions and Cabinet Activities</h3>
<p>The administration has implemented significant policies through executive action. Federal funding will be blocked for states providing driver&rsquo;s licenses to undocumented immigrants [1]. The DOJ has challenged Wikipedia&rsquo;s tax-exempt status over alleged &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; [2], and a new executive order requires truckers to speak English [3]. In personnel changes, President Trump removed Doug Emhoff, husband of former Vice President Harris, from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Council [4], while Elon Musk has begun his &ldquo;planned departure&rdquo; from leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), receiving Cabinet applause at a recent meeting [5]. Senator Marco Rubio has shared information about Biden State Department files with Trump and Cabinet members [6].</p>

<h3 id="13-political-opposition">1.3 Political Opposition</h3>
<p>Congressional opposition appears fragmented. Three House Democrats have requested removal from a resolution to impeach President Trump [1], suggesting internal disagreement about impeachment strategies. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has severely criticized the administration&rsquo;s first 100 days, reportedly summarizing them with a single &ldquo;F-word&rdquo; [2]. Democrats have staged &ldquo;all-night&rdquo; protests against administration policies [3].</p>

<h3 id="21-economic-indicators-and-trade-policy">2.1 Economic Indicators and Trade Policy</h3>
<p>Economic data shows a significant slowdown, with the U.S. economy contracting 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, with tariffs cited as a contributing factor [1]. President Trump has defended these policies, stating tariffs are incentivizing domestic investment while harming China&rsquo;s economy [2]. Democratic Representative Ro Khanna has engaged with tariff issues from what&rsquo;s described as a &ldquo;progressive capitalism&rdquo; perspective [3].</p>

<h3 id="22-budget-and-energy-policy">2.2 Budget and Energy Policy</h3>
<p>According to The Wall Street Journal, the &ldquo;real sticking point&rdquo; in the GOP reconciliation bill is that &ldquo;Republicans won&rsquo;t cut anything&rdquo; [1], suggesting tensions over spending despite traditional fiscal restraint rhetoric. On energy policy, nuclear power is experiencing a revival [2], while Congressional Republicans are considering action to repeal California&rsquo;s electric vehicle mandate [3]. Former congressman Lee Zeldin has outlined 100 Environmental Protection Agency actions intended to &ldquo;Power the American Comeback&rdquo; [4].</p>

<p>Deportation operations have intensified. Mexico reports accepting 39,000 deportees from the United States, with most being Mexican nationals [1]. A DHS official claims MS-13 gang members are becoming &ldquo;desperate&rdquo; due to early enforcement actions by the Trump administration [2]. Tom Homan, in an official capacity, has stated that having U.S.-born children does not protect undocumented immigrants from deportation, calling this &ldquo;Parenting 101&rdquo; [3]. Regarding the previous administration, Homan claimed President Biden was &ldquo;the first president who ever &lsquo;unsecured the border on purpose&rsquo;&rdquo; [4].</p>

<p>Several high-profile cases have captured attention. The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia has generated significant controversy. Court documents from 2018 accuse him of MS-13 gang membership [1], and a 2020 protective order contains allegations of physical abuse and threats [2]. President Trump has stated he &ldquo;could&rdquo; facilitate Garcia&rsquo;s return to El Salvador but &ldquo;won&rsquo;t&rdquo; [3]. In another case, Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Columbia University student, was freed from ICE custody following a judge&rsquo;s orders [4]. Texas hospitals reportedly face a $122 million bill for care provided to undocumented immigrants in a single month [5].</p>

<p>Harvard University has released reports addressing religious tensions through its &ldquo;Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and AntiIsraeli Bias&rdquo; [1]. The reports, described as &ldquo;searing,&rdquo; detail both antisemitism and Islamophobia [2], with Harvard President Alan Garber issuing an apology for the university&rsquo;s failure to adequately address these issues [3]. Separately, Princeton University faces scrutiny over hiring practices, with a professor reportedly claiming &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t hire a white guy&rdquo; under President Christopher Eisgruber&rsquo;s leadership [4].</p>

<p>The Supreme Court is considering a case involving religious education, with liberal justices reportedly &ldquo;grilling&rdquo; representatives from a religious institution [1], though the Court &ldquo;seems open to allowing Oklahoma Catholic charter school&rdquo; [2]. The Trump administration faces multiple legal challenges to immigration policies. A federal judge has ordered local law enforcement to stop enforcing a new immigration law [3], while another judge, appointed during the Biden administration, has blocked Border Patrol from arresting suspected undocumented immigrants without warrants [4]. In Wisconsin, Judge Hannah Dugan was &ldquo;temporarily relieved of official duties&rdquo; after being charged with &ldquo;sabotaging ICE arrest&rdquo; [5]. Attorney Harmeet Dhillon has discussed plans for a Department of Justice office allegedly &ldquo;weaponized under Biden&rdquo; [6].</p>
