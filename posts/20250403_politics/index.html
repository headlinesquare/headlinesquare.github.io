<h3 id="topic-11-tariff-implementation-and-structure">Topic 1.1: Tariff Implementation and Structure</h3>
<p>The Trump administration&rsquo;s sweeping tariffs have shown peculiar implementation patterns. Russia was conspicuously absent from the countries subject to tariffs [1], while uninhabited territories were oddly included [2]. The formula for calculating tariffs has been revealed to be based on trade deficits rather than reciprocal rates [3]. The administration has also ended de minimis treatment for goods from China and Hong Kong [4].</p>

<h3 id="topic-12-economic-and-market-impacts">Topic 1.2: Economic and Market Impacts</h3>
<p>Markets have reacted severely to the tariff announcements, with U.S. stock markets experiencing their worst one-day drop since COVID-19 [1]. Markets lost approximately $3.1 trillion in value [2], while billionaires collectively lost around $208 billion in a single day [3]. The real-world economic impacts are already materializing, with Ford offering employee pricing to all shoppers [4] and Stellantis announcing temporary layoffs of 900 U.S. workers [5].</p>
<p>Economic experts warn these tariffs are the highest in decades [6] and could potentially backfire by design. Estimates suggest the average American family could face $3,800 in additional costs [7].</p>

<h3 id="topic-13-international-responses-and-congressional-opposition">Topic 1.3: International Responses and Congressional Opposition</h3>
<p>Global reactions have been swift and largely retaliatory. Canada announced plans to impose matching 25% tariffs on U.S. automobiles [1], while France&rsquo;s President Macron called on EU companies to freeze investments in the United States [2]. China has urged the U.S. to &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; cancel the reciprocal tariffs while vowing counter-measures [3].</p>
<p>The tariffs have revealed significant fractures within the Republican Party. Several Senate Republicans have broken with the administration, including Senator Ted Cruz who admitted &ldquo;tariffs are a tax on Americans&rdquo; [4]. Former Vice President Mike Pence called the tariffs the &ldquo;largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history&rdquo; [5]. Some GOP lawmakers have already voted with Democrats to cancel tariffs on Canada [6], with senators now seeking legislation to transfer tariff authority from the executive branch to Congress [7].</p>

<p>The White House has terminated multiple National Security Council (NSC) officials following a meeting between President Trump and far-right activist Laura Loomer. Reports indicate that between three and six NSC aides were dismissed [1], with Loomer reportedly &ldquo;pushing for ousters&rdquo; during her Oval Office visit [2].</p>
<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s formal White House role is ending, according to multiple reports [3]. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Musk, has initiated substantial federal workforce reductions, with layoffs spiking by 205% last month to the &ldquo;third-highest ever recorded&rdquo; [4]. Senator Bernie Sanders warned that 67,000 people could die awaiting benefits under Musk-directed cuts to the Social Security Administration [5].</p>
