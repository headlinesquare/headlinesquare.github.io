<p>A controversy has emerged over former FBI Director James Comey&rsquo;s social media post featuring &ldquo;86 47,&rdquo; which the White House condemned as an attempt to put a &ldquo;hit&rdquo; on President Trump [1]. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard escalated the response, stating Comey should be &ldquo;put behind bars&rdquo; for &ldquo;issuing a hit&rdquo; on Trump [2]. President Trump himself addressed the post, asserting that Comey &ldquo;knew exactly what it meant&rdquo; and explicitly characterizing it as a call for &ldquo;assassination&rdquo; [3]. The Secret Service has launched an investigation into this deleted Instagram post [4]. Reports indicate Trump officials plan to release audio recordings from Biden&rsquo;s special counsel interview [5].</p>

<p>Representative Al Green has filed articles of impeachment against President Trump after a previous attempt failed [1]. Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;big, beautiful bill&rdquo; faces significant legislative obstacles, having suffered a &ldquo;massive blow&rdquo; in a key procedural vote [2] and being subsequently voted down in a House panel, prompting angry responses from Trump directed at Republican &ldquo;grandstanders&rdquo; [3]. House Republicans are advancing legislation to expand concealed-carry rights for police officers while simultaneously working to protect the National Firearms Act [4]. In a separate development, a congressman has introduced a bill to study &ldquo;TDS,&rdquo; described as a psychological condition [5].</p>

<p>Media reports indicate Axios has obtained audio recordings of Special Counsel Robert Hur&rsquo;s 2023 interviews with then-President Biden, revealing &ldquo;repeated mental lapses&rdquo; and struggles to recall words and dates, with claims that the Biden White House withheld these recordings [1]. A Stanford Hoover Institution study has concluded that AI bias predominantly &ldquo;leans left&rdquo; [2], while Senator Markwayne Mullin has reportedly challenged media coverage regarding Trump&rsquo;s Qatar plane [3]. One commentator claimed a Democratic strategist admitted Trump&rsquo;s legal troubles were an orchestrated hit job [4].</p>
