<p>The Supreme Court is showing significant internal divisions on immigration cases. Justices Gorsuch and Roberts joined liberal colleagues on a key immigration ruling [1], while Justice Alito rebuked what he termed &ldquo;midnight deportation interference&rdquo; [2]. Legal analyst Jonathan Turley suggests the Court is &ldquo;increasingly frustrated&rdquo; with &ldquo;half-baked&rdquo; challenges to Trump&rsquo;s deportation policies [3].</p>
<p>A federal judge blocked the administration&rsquo;s efforts to dismantle Voice of America [4], while the 9th Circuit reversed a district court decision that had impeded immigration enforcement [5]. The CFPB admitted a &ldquo;misstep&rdquo; in a settlement case [6], and news organization Nexstar reportedly fired a reporter to avoid a Trump defamation lawsuit [7]. At the state level, a New Mexico judge resigned after a man with alleged Tren de Aragua ties was arrested at his residence [8].</p>
