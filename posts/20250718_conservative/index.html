DAILY BRIEFING
1. Investigations, Justice &amp; Legal Affairs 1.1 “Russiagate” Intelligence Declassification The most significant intelligence-related development is a major declassification action by the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. Multiple news reports, citing the newly public documents, allege that the Obama administration engaged in a coordinated effort to “‘manufactured’ intelligence to create [the] 2016 Russian election interference narrative” [1, 2]. One headline claims that Obama-era officials deliberately “spiked intel that cleared Trump in 2016” [3]. DNI Gabbard is directly quoted framing the events as a “’treasonous conspiracy in 2016 committed by officials at the highest level of our government’” [1]. The declassification has also renewed scrutiny of a key figure from that period, with one report from Tablet Magazine posing the question of whether former CIA Director Brennan may have engaged in “forgery” by falsifying evidence central to the Russiagate narrative [4].">

<p>The most significant intelligence-related development is a major declassification action by the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. Multiple news reports, citing the newly public documents, allege that the Obama administration engaged in a coordinated effort to &ldquo;&lsquo;manufactured&rsquo; intelligence to create [the] 2016 Russian election interference narrative&rdquo; [1, 2].

The declassification has also renewed scrutiny of a key figure from that period, with one report from Tablet Magazine posing the question of whether former CIA Director Brennan may have engaged in &ldquo;forgery&rdquo; by falsifying evidence central to the Russiagate narrative [4].</p>

<p>High-profile federal officials are reportedly facing legal jeopardy. A criminal referral has been made against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for an unspecified act of &ldquo;Alleged Perjury&rdquo; [1]. Separately, a criminal referral has been filed against Rep. Adam Schiff, which reportedly &ldquo;details possible violations of federal laws&rdquo; [2]. The specific statutes or actions involved in the Schiff referral are not delineated in the headline.</p>

<h3 id="13-former-department-of-justice-actions-under-review">1.3 Former Department of Justice Actions Under Review</h3>
<p>Past actions by the Department of Justice are being re-examined. According to a Fox News report citing undisclosed documents, the Biden-era DOJ &ldquo;actively sought a &lsquo;federal hook&rsquo;&rdquo; for a controversial school board memo [1]. The memo in question is related to the labeling of some parents at school board meetings as &ldquo;&lsquo;domestic terrorists&rsquo;&rdquo;; the exact nature of the &ldquo;federal hook&rdquo; the department sought is not specified in the report.</p>

<p>Attention is also being paid to other ongoing matters of legal and political interest. An article from The Federalist reports that &ldquo;3 Biden Aides Plead 5th To Avoid Truth About Puppet Presidency,&rdquo; although the identities of the aides and the specific investigative context are not provided [1]. Additionally, an un-detailed, self-posted &ldquo;Epstein Thread&rdquo; indicates continued public discussion and interest in the Jeffrey Epstein case and its aftermath [2].</p>

<h3 id="21-fiscal-policy--federal-budget">2.1 Fiscal Policy &amp; Federal Budget</h3>
<p>Congress has passed and sent a significant &ldquo;rescissions package&rdquo; to the President for his signature. The bill enacts &ldquo;$9B [in] federal spending cuts&rdquo; and was approved after a late-night vote [1, 2]. The passage of the &ldquo;GOP-spearheaded bill&rdquo; in the House was reportedly followed by a rise in stock market values [3]. These fiscal maneuvers are occurring against a backdrop of long-term concern, with one analysis from The Federalist warning that the &ldquo;U.S. Debt Situation Will Soon Be Worse Than Right After WWII&rdquo; [4].</p>

<h3 id="22-administrative-actions-and-regulatory-changes">2.2 Administrative Actions and Regulatory Changes</h3>
<p>The Trump administration is actively pursuing regulatory changes, meeting both success and resistance. The Department of Justice has reportedly launched a formal process designed to &ldquo;Restore Gun Rights to Millions&rdquo; of Americans, though the headline makes clear that certain individuals will remain ineligible [1]. However, a key initiative to &ldquo;reshape [the] Federal Trade Commission&rdquo; has been &ldquo;blocked by [a] DC judge,&rdquo; representing a significant legal setback for the administration&rsquo;s agenda [2]. On another front, an unnamed Republican Attorney General has issued a public call to terminate a federal DEI program, which they allege &ldquo;&lsquo;Wastes Money On Purpose&rsquo;&rdquo; [3].</p>

In a separate development related to media and culture, President Trump has commented on the recent cancellation of &lsquo;The Late Show,&rsquo; stating, &ldquo;&lsquo;I Love that Colbert Got Fired&rsquo;&rdquo; and speculating, &ldquo;&lsquo;I Hear Jimmy Kimmel Is Next&rsquo;&rdquo; [2]. The President also weighed in on a separate, unspecified legal matter, noting &ldquo;I Look Forward to Watching Rupert Murdoch Testify&rdquo; [3].

<p>Federal immigration enforcement has reportedly intensified dramatically. A Breitbart report claims that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 30,000 undocumented immigrants in the month of June, a figure described as &ldquo;the most in at least half a decade&rdquo; [1]. In a significant move related to inter-agency data sharing, it is reported that the Trump administration provided &ldquo;Medicaid recipients&rsquo; personal data, including addresses, to ICE&rdquo; [2]. A specific enforcement action at a Home Depot in California resulted in the arrest of 11 undocumented individuals. One of the arrested individuals reportedly had a criminal history that included &ldquo;67 prior jail bookings in California since 1986 and a prior deadly fentanyl trafficking conviction&rdquo; [3].</p>

<p>Immigration policy remains a focus of sharp legislative and political debate. Reports indicate that the White House has &ldquo;shot down&rdquo; an &ldquo;Amnesty and Migration Bill&rdquo; introduced by Representative Salazar [1]. Opposition to such a bill is articulated in a piece from The Federalist, which argues that it would &ldquo;Allow Illegals To Keep Using U.S. As A Piggy Bank&rdquo; [2]. A counter-narrative from Counterpunch highlights a practical &ldquo;conundrum&rdquo; for the administration&rsquo;s stated campaign of mass deportation, pointing to the agricultural sector&rsquo;s reliance on &ldquo;Undocumented Farm Workers&rdquo; [3].</p>

<p>Issues of electoral processes and education standards are being debated at the state level. In New Jersey, a report cited by The Federalist claims the state&rsquo;s voter rolls are a &ldquo;mess&rdquo; and contain &ldquo;More Than 32,000 ‘Questionable’ Voter Records&rdquo; [1]. In a separate development, Tennessee is reportedly considering a significant change to its educational standards by dropping the foreign language requirement for high school graduation [2].</p>
