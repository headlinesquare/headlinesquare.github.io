<p>Recent polls suggest public concerns about President Biden&rsquo;s fitness during his final year in office, with one indicating that &ldquo;most Americans say Biden wasn&rsquo;t fit in final year&rdquo; [1]. Reports have emerged that the Biden administration labeled those who opposed COVID-19 policies as &ldquo;domestic violent extremists&rdquo; [2]. In regulatory shifts, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has issued new guidelines for Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs), which effectively ends what one source describes as Biden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Zero Tolerance&rdquo; policy [3]. Media outlets continue to analyze the former president&rsquo;s cognitive state, with one questioning whether Democrats will &ldquo;learn anything from the Biden decline cover-up&rdquo; [4].</p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom is described as &ldquo;furious&rdquo; and &ldquo;vows legal fight&rdquo; following the Senate&rsquo;s repeal of an EV mandate waiver [2], while facing separate criticism of his record on homelessness [3]. Judicial controversies continue, with one source characterizing a judge as &ldquo;pro-discrimination&rdquo; who &ldquo;backs Harvard vs. Trump&rdquo; [4], while another reports that a &ldquo;liberal district judge in Boston commands Trump administration to facilitate return of a deported Guatemalan alien&rdquo; [5].
