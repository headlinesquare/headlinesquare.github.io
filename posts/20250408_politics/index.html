The White House characterized tensions between Musk and trade adviser Peter Navarro as &ldquo;boys will be boys&rdquo; [6], while Democratic oversight committees probe &ldquo;White House Use of Musk&rsquo;s Starlink&rdquo; citing &ldquo;considerable red flags&rdquo; [7].</p>

<p>The White House confirmed tariffs on China will increase to at least 104% on Wednesday [1], prompting Beijing to characterize this as &ldquo;a mistake upon a mistake&rdquo; [2] and vow to &ldquo;fight to the end&rdquo; [3]. China implemented significant countermeasures, including export controls on key rare earth materials [4]. Economists warn of a &ldquo;Category 5 Price Storm&rdquo; [5], while one researcher claims the White House &ldquo;cited my research to justify tariffs&rdquo; but &ldquo;got it all wrong&rdquo; [6]. The administration is considering adjusting a port fee plan for Chinese vessels after receiving pushback [7].</p>

<p>Trump&rsquo;s tariffs are already reducing car imports and idling factories [1], with JPMorgan assessing recession risk at 60% [2] and Wall Street traders stating &ldquo;Without doubt, we&rsquo;re hitting a recession&rdquo; [3]. Canada is imposing tariffs of up to 25% on vehicles imported from the U.S. in retaliation [4].
