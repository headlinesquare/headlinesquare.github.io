<h3 id="12-executive-authority-and-government-restructuring">1.2 Executive Authority and Government Restructuring</h3>
<p>The Trump administration faces several controversies related to executive power and government restructuring. Reports suggest Trump is attempting to exert control over Congress through the Library of Congress [1], with senior Justice Department officials appointed to oversee the institution being denied access [2]. USAID is reported to be &ldquo;all but gone,&rdquo; a loss that has affected three generations of service [3]. Executive Order 14270, dubbed &ldquo;The Extinction Order&rdquo; by critics, has drawn concern as it reportedly &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t deregulate&rdquo; government functions but rather &ldquo;dismantles&rdquo; them [4].</p>

<p>The Trump Organization has entered a Qatari golf resort deal, indicating it &ldquo;is not holding back from foreign business&rdquo; despite Trump&rsquo;s return to office [1]. The President&rsquo;s trip to the Middle East has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest, as he is visiting three countries that have reportedly made recent deals with the Trump Organization [2]. A Trump family Bitcoin company has announced plans to go public [3].</p>

<p>The United States and China have reached a trade agreement following discussions in Geneva [1]. This 90-day agreement includes significant tariff reductions [2] in what CNN describes as a &ldquo;major trade breakthrough&rdquo; [3]. However, multiple sources characterize the deal as a major U.S. concession, describing it as &ldquo;the ultimate bait and switch&rdquo; [4] with Chinese President Xi&rsquo;s &ldquo;defiance&rdquo; approach yielding results as Trump reportedly met &ldquo;most Chinese trade demands&rdquo; [5]. Financial markets responded positively, with stocks &ldquo;soaring&rdquo; following the announcement [6].</p>

<h3 id="22-fiscal-policy-and-tax-legislation">2.2 Fiscal Policy and Tax Legislation</h3>
<p>House Republicans are advancing significant tax legislation with contentious provisions. They &ldquo;want budget cuts, but not the political consequences&rdquo; [1] that would follow implementing them. GOP lawmakers are working to &ldquo;claw back Biden&rsquo;s climate law to fund Trump tax cuts&rdquo; [2], while experiencing internal conflicts over the tax cuts in what Trump calls &ldquo;one big beautiful bill&rdquo; [3]. Their tax plan includes a proposed increase of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $30,000, though this remains disputed by some blue-state Republicans who call it a &ldquo;nonstarter&rdquo; [4].</p>

<p>The Trump administration&rsquo;s aggressive immigration enforcement is generating significant controversy. Bloomberg reports that the administration&rsquo;s &ldquo;deportation plans hinge on small towns hooked on private prisons&rdquo; [1]. ICE operations are creating &ldquo;terrible optics&rdquo; that are fueling a backlash against Trump&rsquo;s immigration policies [2]. Cases of family separation have emerged, including an account of a mother who took her sons to an ICE check-in and &ldquo;never saw them again,&rdquo; despite them having no criminal records and actively pursuing green cards [3]. Tensions with local officials have escalated, with Newark Mayor Ras Baraka &ldquo;arrested for visiting [an] ICE jail&rdquo; and &ldquo;slams Trump Admin&rsquo;s &lsquo;insane&rsquo; abuse of power&rdquo; [4].</p>

<p>The Trump administration has dramatically redrawn U.S. refugee policy by granting refugee status to white South Africans (Afrikaners), claiming they face racial discrimination, while simultaneously suspending the program for all other groups [1]. The first 49 Afrikaners have arrived in the U.S. under this controversial program [2]. White South Africans &ldquo;make up around 7% of the population&rdquo; yet own &ldquo;some 78% of private farmland&rdquo; [3]. The policy shift has met significant resistance from the Episcopal Church, which has refused to help resettle these white South Africans, citing &ldquo;moral opposition&rdquo; [4].</p>
