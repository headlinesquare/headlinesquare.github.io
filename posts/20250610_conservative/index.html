<p>Civil unrest related to ICE enforcement operations has intensified in Los Angeles and spread to other cities including Texas and San Francisco [1]. Property damage has been reported, with Apple retail stores and a CVS pharmacy in downtown Los Angeles looted during nighttime hours [2] [3].

Don&rsquo;t believe what you saw&rdquo; [5] and &ldquo;There was NO violence. Get it in your head&rdquo; [6]. These statements contrast with reports claiming casualties [7]. Questions have emerged about who is organizing the protests [8], with some reports suggesting &ldquo;well-funded, organized leftists&rdquo; have played a role [9].</p>

<p>The federal government has escalated its response by deploying military personnel. U.S. Marines have been ordered to Los Angeles to assist in controlling the demonstrations [1], with reports indicating approximately 700 Marines already deployed [2]. President Trump has authorized an additional 2,000 National Guard troops to the region [3]. The Pentagon has developed specific &ldquo;use of force&rdquo; protocols for military personnel operating in this context [2].</p>
<p>In New York City, law enforcement has reportedly arrested &ldquo;dozens&rdquo; of anti-ICE protesters at Trump Tower [4].
