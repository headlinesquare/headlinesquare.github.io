<p>The Trump administration has designated land along the U.S.-Mexico border as a military installation, allowing soldiers to directly apprehend migrants crossing the border [1]. President Trump has signed a directive aimed at preventing illegal immigrants from receiving Social Security payments [2]. In a separate case, a Columbia University activist in ICE custody who allegedly endorsed the October 7 attack has received fundraising support from Ilhan Omar&rsquo;s daughter [3]. An El Salvadoran immigrant has been identified as Rachel Morin&rsquo;s killer, described as a &ldquo;mom of 5&rdquo; [4], with major networks CNN and MSNBC criticized for not covering an appearance by Morin&rsquo;s mother at the White House [5].</p>

<h3 id="21-economic-and-trade-initiatives">2.1 Economic and Trade Initiatives</h3>
<p>A new study about the IRS has revealed significant tax savings from Trump tax cuts, particularly benefiting Americans earning less than $75,000 [1]. The administration&rsquo;s tariff policies have drawn both criticism and support, with defenders arguing they are necessary to protect American interests against globalism [2]. President Trump has stated he is in &ldquo;no rush&rdquo; to end tariffs during a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Meloni [3]. In response to these policies, Nissan has announced plans to maximize its U.S. production [4], while Chinese small businesses have reportedly put U.S. orders on hold [5]. Trump has also met with a Japanese trade delegation and reported &ldquo;big progress&rdquo; [6].</p>

<h3 id="22-federal-agency-reforms">2.2 Federal Agency Reforms</h3>
<p>Significant changes are underway in federal agencies. Reports indicate one in five IRS employees are resigning [1]. Secretary of State Rubio has announced the closure of the State Department&rsquo;s Global Engagement Center (GEC), described as a &ldquo;censorship program&rdquo; that the Biden administration had previously claimed was ended [2][3]. Some conservatives have expressed alarm over the administration&rsquo;s implementation of REAL ID, characterizing it as &ldquo;mass surveillance&rdquo; [4]. The administration has appointed to lead the IRS an agent who allegedly exposed federal efforts to cover up investigations related to the Biden family [5] and reportedly &ldquo;outmaneuvered&rdquo; Senate Majority Leader Schumer on the selection of a top federal prosecutor [6].</p>
