<p>National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and his deputy, Alex Wong, have both resigned from their positions [1][2].

<p>The administration has implemented several notable policy initiatives. A significant diplomatic achievement includes securing the release of the &ldquo;47th wrongfully detained American citizen abroad&rdquo; [1]. The White House has announced plans to implement a &ldquo;system of merit&rdquo; while dismantling what it terms DEI &ldquo;strangulation&rdquo; [2]. The administration has also intervened in regulatory disputes, supporting a ranching family fighting &ldquo;Biden-era charges&rdquo; in a land battle [3].</p>

<h3 id="21-enforcement-operations-and-deportations">2.1 Enforcement Operations and Deportations</h3>
<p>Immigration enforcement operations have intensified across multiple regions. In Florida, ICE in coordination with state law enforcement has conducted a major operation resulting in the arrest of &ldquo;nearly 800 illegal aliens&rdquo; [1]. In Colorado, ICE has imposed fines exceeding $8 million on Denver businesses for &ldquo;knowingly hiring unauthorized workers&rdquo; [2]. At the northern border, authorities have apprehended &ldquo;Venezuelan gangsters&hellip; by the dozens&rdquo; since President Trump&rsquo;s inauguration [3].</p>

<h3 id="22-border-policy-implementation">2.2 Border Policy Implementation</h3>
<p>Border enforcement changes under the Trump administration are being contrasted with previous policies. An Arizona rancher claims he has &ldquo;not seen a body since Trump was elected&rdquo; [1] and sources indicate that Border Patrol agent morale, recruitment, and prosecution rates have increased [2]. A Louisiana widow has stated that &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s border crackdown could save families like hers from being torn apart&rdquo; [3]. A Democratic lawmaker has &ldquo;demanded Congress act on securing US border&rdquo; following a visit to an ICE facility [4].</p>

<h3 id="23-legal-challenges-to-immigration-policies">2.3 Legal Challenges to Immigration Policies</h3>
<p>Legal challenges to immigration enforcement actions are creating uncertainty. A California judge&rsquo;s ruling on warrantless migrant arrests has reportedly &ldquo;sown confusion&rdquo; [1]. President Trump has urged the Supreme Court to remove legal protections for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants [2]. A federal judge has &ldquo;opened the door&rdquo; to allowing targets of the Alien Enemies Act to sue the Trump administration [3].</p>
