<p>Elon Musk has officially departed from his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Reports offer different contexts for his exit: some indicate he completed his scheduled work streamlining government operations [1, 2], while another suggests his departure followed criticism of a &ldquo;big beautiful bill&rdquo; [3]. The White House has announced that some DOGE-recommended cuts will be sent to Congress next week, though full implementation will take &ldquo;several months&rdquo; [4]. Questions remain about DOGE&rsquo;s future, with reports noting Musk has returned to his private companies while leaving behind &ldquo;devotees who are accumulating power and influence&rdquo; [5].</p>

<p>A social media post claims that the Supreme Court has issued a decision giving the Trump administration &ldquo;full control of federal agencies&rdquo; and declaring that the &ldquo;lawfare era is over&rdquo; [1]. According to this post, the ruling &ldquo;strikes directly at the administrative state — the fourth, unelected branch of government that has operated unchecked for decades.&rdquo; No details about the case name, legal reasoning, or actual scope of the decision are provided in the headline.</p>

<p>Federal courts have issued multiple rulings limiting President Trump&rsquo;s executive actions. A federal trade court has struck down what were called &ldquo;Liberation Day&rdquo; tariffs [1] and blocked the administration from imposing &ldquo;sweeping tariffs under emergency powers law&rdquo; [2]. Reports indicate that the &ldquo;vast majority&rdquo; of Trump&rsquo;s signature tariffs have been blocked by judicial action [3]. In a separate case, a U.S. judge has blocked the administration from suspending Biden-era migrant &ldquo;parole&rdquo; programs [4]. Presidential advisor Stephen Miller has characterized the tariffs ruling as a &ldquo;judicial coup&rdquo; [5].</p>

<p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against North Carolina&rsquo;s Elections Board for allegedly registering voters without proper identification [1] and launched an investigation into an unspecified California policy [2]. The FBI has reportedly assessed that a Fusion GPS contractor &ldquo;likely lied to Congress&rdquo; regarding their role in the Trump-Russia probe [3] and is investigating an attack on a Christian prayer rally in Seattle where someone reportedly &ldquo;pulled a knife on a 17-year-old&rdquo; [4].
