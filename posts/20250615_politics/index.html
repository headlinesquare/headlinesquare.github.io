<p>President Trump has deployed federal troops against civilians in California in response to protests against immigration raids. The Guardian reports that Trump &ldquo;seized on LA protests against immigration raids to deploy troops against civilians in the liberal bastion – a fight he had long been spoiling for&rdquo; [1]. This federal intervention has triggered resistance from state leaders, with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro &ldquo;reaffirming his control over Pennsylvania&rsquo;s National Guard after Trump took control of California&rsquo;s troops&rdquo; [2] while Governor Gavin Newsom has developed a strategy to resist what he characterizes as federal overreach [3].</p>
<p>The administration has implemented multiple significant policy changes in rapid succession, with states struggling to adapt to a broadband overhaul that reportedly compressed &ldquo;two years of work into two months&rdquo; [4]. The administration has taken aggressive action against California with reports indicating broad-based policy changes being implemented simultaneously [5].</p>

<p>The Trump administration has conducted immigration raids described as both &ldquo;stunning, yet predictable&rdquo; [1], with reports detailing an &ldquo;extraordinary turnaround&rdquo; in the president&rsquo;s approach to such operations [2]. Border Patrol has significantly expanded its &ldquo;roving patrols,&rdquo; raising civil rights concerns as U.S. citizens are now being detained during these operations, heightening fears of racial profiling in affected communities [3].</p>
<p>Despite the aggressive enforcement posture, President Trump has modified immigration enforcement policies to exclude certain economic sectors, reportedly &ldquo;curbing immigration enforcement at farms, meatpacking plants, hotels and restaurants&rdquo; [4]. This apparent policy shift has drawn attention as &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s backtrack on immigration&rdquo; [5], while economists have warned that &ldquo;U.S. immigration decline could fuel inflation, stall growth&rdquo; [6].</p>

<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed new vaccine advisers who have drawn scrutiny. According to reports, these include an emergency room doctor who posted Islamophobic commentary online and individuals who have previously served as expert witnesses against vaccines [1]. An overhaul associated with Kennedy is forecast to drive up the cost of vaccines, as reported by The Hill [2].</p>
