He warned Iran that the U.S. would &ldquo;come down on you at levels never seen before&rdquo; if they attack American interests [3]. Israel has formally requested U.S. military participation in strikes on Iran&rsquo;s nuclear sites [4]. Analysis suggests &ldquo;Netanyahu outplayed Trump on Iran,&rdquo; with warnings that &ldquo;the US risks being mired in another war&rdquo; [5].</p>

<p>Los Angeles police deployed aggressive crowd control measures against &ldquo;No Kings&rdquo; protesters, using flash-bangs, rubber bullets, and tear gas [1][2]. President Trump has deployed troops against civilians in Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration raids [3]. Protesters have framed their opposition in constitutional terms, with demonstrators quoted saying &ldquo;He&rsquo;s shredding our constitution, our government&rdquo; [4]. Historical parallels to authoritarian regimes are being drawn by those with direct experience, including someone who was &ldquo;disappeared under Argentina&rsquo;s dictatorship&rdquo; warning they &ldquo;know how autocracy begins&rdquo; [5].</p>

<h3 id="31-military-parade">3.1 Military Parade</h3>
<p>President Trump presided over a $45 million military parade that coincided with his birthday and the U.S. Army&rsquo;s 250th anniversary [1][2]. Multiple reports indicate the event was met with &ldquo;empty seats&rdquo; and an &ldquo;underwhelming crowd&rdquo; [3][4]. UK media describes the events as &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s Soviet-style parades&rdquo; that &ldquo;show he is turning the tide against himself&rdquo; [5]. Senator John Fetterman notably broke with many Democrats to praise the event, stating it was &ldquo;comprised of &rsquo;the very best of us&rsquo; and should be celebrated&rdquo; [6].</p>

<p>President Trump has made what the New York Times describes as an &ldquo;extraordinary turnaround&rdquo; on immigration enforcement [1]. While raids continue in some areas, the administration has specifically &ldquo;curbs immigration enforcement at farms, meatpacking plants, hotels and restaurants&rdquo; [2]. Reports indicate raids are still affecting American citizens, including a &ldquo;Southern California father who is U.S. citizen, arrested during immigration raid&rdquo; [3]. Economists warn that declining immigration could have significant negative economic consequences, potentially fueling inflation and stalling economic growth [4]. Meanwhile, the administration appears to be expanding travel restrictions, with reports indicating Trump &ldquo;Mulls Adding 36 More Countries to Travel Ban&rdquo; [5].</p>
