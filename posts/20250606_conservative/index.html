<p>A significant public rift has emerged between President Trump and Elon Musk following Musk&rsquo;s departure from DOGE. Polling shows Republicans overwhelmingly supporting Trump (71%) over Musk (6%) [1]. Trump has declined Musk&rsquo;s meeting request and is reportedly considering selling his Tesla [2], describing Musk as &ldquo;the man who lost his mind&rdquo; [3].</p>
<p>Despite the tension, Trump&rsquo;s aides have scheduled a call with Musk for Friday [4], and Musk has acknowledged they should &ldquo;make peace&rdquo; for the country&rsquo;s benefit [5]. The dispute has provoked extreme reactions from Trump allies, with former White House advisor Steve Bannon calling for Musk&rsquo;s deportation and SpaceX seizure [6].</p>
<p>White House sources have revealed details about what they term a &ldquo;Big Beautiful Breakup&rdquo; and Musk&rsquo;s &ldquo;final straw&rdquo; [7]. The conflict involves claims about Trump&rsquo;s connections to Jeffrey Epstein, with Musk&rsquo;s AI chatbot Grok contradicting Musk&rsquo;s allegations by stating there&rsquo;s &ldquo;no indication of wrongdoing&rdquo; [8].</p>
