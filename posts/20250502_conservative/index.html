<p>The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April 2025, exceeding market expectations despite ongoing tariff uncertainty [1] [2]. Multiple sources confirm this figure, with descriptions of the performance as &ldquo;better than expected&rdquo; and references to the economy &ldquo;defying doomsayers&rdquo; [3]. However, reports also note a stalling labor market and shrinking GDP under the Trump administration [4]. Government workforce reduction continues for the fourth consecutive month, decreasing from a record high of 2.413 million workers [5]. Following the jobs report, President Trump renewed calls for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates [6].</p>

Chinese authorities have reportedly exempted approximately $40 billion worth of U.S. imports from tariffs [2] and indicated openness to tariff negotiations, with reports that China is &ldquo;open to talks&rdquo; with the Trump administration [3]. Businessman Kevin O&rsquo;Leary has advocated for 400 percent tariffs on Chinese imports [4].
