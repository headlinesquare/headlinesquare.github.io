<h3 id="21-tariffs-and-trade-impacts">2.1 Tariffs and Trade Impacts</h3>
<p>The administration&rsquo;s tariff policies are disrupting supply chains with the expiration of the &ldquo;de minimis exemption&rdquo; imposing tariffs on millions of Americans&rsquo; purchases [1][2]. U.S. ports experience slowdowns described as &ldquo;a warning of rough economic seas ahead&rdquo; [3], while factories needing Chinese machinery remain in limbo [4]. Apple reports difficulty predicting tariff costs, having already relocated half of iPhone production to India [5]. Business responses vary—companies are withdrawing financial guidance amid uncertainty [6] and raising prices [7], with auto workers welcoming tariffs despite Wall Street concerns [8].</p>

<h3 id="22-budget-cuts-and-economic-outlook">2.2 Budget Cuts and Economic Outlook</h3>
<p>The Trump administration has proposed $163 billion in non-defense spending cuts [1], with House Republicans working to implement $1.5 trillion in reductions [2]. The 2026 budget targets health, education, and clean energy programs while boosting military funding [3], eliminates disaster relief promised to rural communities [4], and reduces EPA staffing to 1980s levels [5]. Despite these cuts, April&rsquo;s jobs report showed 177,000 jobs added [6], though economists report a 75% probability of recession [7]. Trump has called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates [8].</p>
