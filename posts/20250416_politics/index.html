<p>California, led by Governor Newsom, has become the first state to file a lawsuit challenging Trump&rsquo;s tariffs [1], launching what headlines describe as a legal challenge against &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; tariffs. The administration has reportedly &ldquo;denied FEMA funds to Democratic-led states,&rdquo; with critics noting this continues a pattern of &ldquo;imposing conditions on critical funds for disaster recovery&rdquo; [2]. The Trump administration has sued Maine over transgender athlete participation in girls sports [3], with Maine Governor Janet Mills &ldquo;hitting back&rdquo; against the federal lawsuit. The administration has referred New York Attorney General Letitia James for potential prosecution over alleged mortgage fraud [4].</p>

<p>The World Trade Organization warns Trump&rsquo;s tariffs will cause global trade to contract [1] and &ldquo;badly hurt&rdquo; U.S. and global economies.
