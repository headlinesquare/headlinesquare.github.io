<p>Elon Musk, head of DOGE, stated the department&rsquo;s success depends on cooperation from both Congress and the Executive Branch [1]. DOGE has attempted to expand influence beyond the executive branch, with some targets reportedly pushing back [2]. Musk announced he will reduce his political spending, stating &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve done enough&rdquo; [3], a withdrawal affecting Republican funding expectations [4]. His government role appears to be impacting his business interests, with reports that &ldquo;The Reputation Scores of Musk&rsquo;s Tesla and SpaceX Are Nosediving&rdquo; [5].</p>

<h3 id="13-administration-controversies">1.3 Administration Controversies</h3>
<p>A controversy has emerged regarding a Qatari aircraft and President Trump. Initially characterized as a &ldquo;gift,&rdquo; Qatar defended the arrangement as a &ldquo;normal transaction&rdquo; [1]. Subsequent reporting revealed Trump&rsquo;s administration approached Qatar about acquiring the jet for presidential use [2] rather than it being an unsolicited gift. The Qatari Prime Minister denied the arrangement constitutes bribery [3]. In a separate controversy, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem faced criticism for incorrectly defining habeas corpus as &ldquo;the President&rsquo;s right to deport people&rdquo; during Senate testimony [4].</p>

<p>Peace prospects in Ukraine have deteriorated following communications between President Trump and Russian President Putin. After their call, Trump reportedly backed away from ceasefire efforts [1]. During a call with European Union leaders, Ukrainian President Zelensky had to remind Trump that peace talks were already underway [2]. Trump&rsquo;s apparent deference to Putin during these communications &ldquo;stunned European leaders&rdquo; [3] and &ldquo;seriously freaked out European allies&rdquo; [4].</p>

<p>President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth have unveiled plans for a $175 billion space-based missile defense system called the &ldquo;Golden Dome&rdquo; [1][2]. The administration has selected a design and appointed leadership for this project, with reports indicating potential initial funding of $25 billion [3].
