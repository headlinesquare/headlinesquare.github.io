<p>President Trump has made statements raising fundamental questions about constitutional authority. When asked if he must uphold constitutional due process, Trump reportedly said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; [1]. Despite these concerns, he has explicitly stated he won&rsquo;t seek a third term, saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be an eight-year president&rdquo; [2]. Senior adviser Stephen Miller has presented what critics describe as a &ldquo;totally made up definition&rdquo; of constitutional due process protections [3].</p>
<p>The president has directed the Bureau of Prisons to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison [4], specifying it would house the country&rsquo;s &ldquo;most ruthless&rdquo; offenders [5]. The administration is considering labeling some suspected cartel and gang members inside the United States as &ldquo;enemy combatants&rdquo; [6] and has introduced a financial incentive program offering $1,000 to undocumented immigrants who voluntarily leave the country [7].</p>

<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, faces scrutiny over its effectiveness. Reports indicate that despite workforce reductions, savings are minimal and offset by degraded government services [1]. Questions have emerged about DOGE&rsquo;s actual purpose beyond cost-cutting [2]. Musk has stated that he and Trump are aligned &ldquo;80% of the time&rdquo; [3]. House Democrats have launched an investigation into Musk&rsquo;s potential conflicts of interest [4].</p>

<p>President Trump has announced a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the United States [1], an unprecedented move targeting the entertainment industry. Reports indicate actor Jon Voight met with Trump before the proposal was announced [2]. The White House states &ldquo;no final decisions&rdquo; have been made [3]. UK concerns have emerged that such tariffs could &ldquo;wipe out&rdquo; their film industry [4].</p>
<p>Beyond film, Trump has expanded tariffs to include small packages from China [5] and suggested tariffs on dolls, stating U.S. girls &ldquo;could be very happy with lots fewer dolls&rdquo; under new tariffs [6]. Chinese exporters are reportedly circumventing Trump&rsquo;s tariffs by routing products through third countries [7]. These policies have triggered significant international backlash, with European consumers boycotting American brands [8] and a Canadian boycott reportedly &ldquo;ravaging&rdquo; U.S. border towns [9].</p>

<p>Economic analyses warn of challenges arising from current policies. The Washington Post reports that Trump&rsquo;s trade war and interest rates are weighing on housing and the broader economy [1]. Some analysts warn that current policies could &ldquo;make Americans permanently poorer&rdquo; [2], while others have published guidance on preparing for what they term a &ldquo;Trumpcession&rdquo; [3]. The global economy is &ldquo;already feeling drag from Trump tariffs&rdquo; [4].</p>
<p>Student loan collections officially restarted on May 5, affecting more than 5 million borrowers in default [5], with the administration reportedly preparing to implement wage garnishment [6]. Social Security has reduced its benefit clawback rate from 100% to 50% for certain beneficiaries, although experts still warn of &ldquo;devastating&rdquo; effects [7]. Republican lawmakers are exploring &ldquo;per capita caps&rdquo; as a mechanism to generate Medicaid savings [8], with analysis suggesting the &ldquo;Republican Budget Plan Could Kick Millions Off Medicaid&rdquo; [9].</p>
