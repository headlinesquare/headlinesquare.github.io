<h3 id="12-first-100-days-assessment">1.2 First 100 Days Assessment</h3>
<p>Early assessments of the administration&rsquo;s performance show mixed opinions. Historian Niall Ferguson claims &ldquo;Donald Trump Is Crushing His To-Do List&rdquo; [1], suggesting rapid implementation of campaign promises. Johnson has stated Trump &ldquo;has achieved more in 100 days than &lsquo;most presidents&rsquo; in their lifetimes&rdquo; [2], while analysts debate appropriate metrics for measuring the administration&rsquo;s early success [3]. The administration&rsquo;s economic initiatives include a proposed $5,000 bonus aimed at addressing declining birth rates, though critics question its effectiveness [4].</p>

The Department of Justice has initiated review of Wikipedia&rsquo;s tax-exempt status, citing alleged violations and &ldquo;propaganda&rdquo; [2]. The newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is reviewing federal health programs with potential to &ldquo;improve the programs that fight HIV/AIDS&rdquo; [3], while implementation challenges persist with existing programs as the REAL ID rollout faces potential delays [4].</p>

<h3 id="21-tax-reform--federal-revenue">2.1 Tax Reform &amp; Federal Revenue</h3>
<p>President Trump has announced a bold tax reform vision centered on potentially eliminating federal income taxes through tariff revenue. Multiple sources report Trump&rsquo;s statement that tariffs will lead to &ldquo;income tax relief, even elimination&rdquo; [1], with the President specifically claiming he&rsquo;ll &ldquo;abolish income tax with tariff money&rdquo; [2]. This proposal represents a significant potential shift in U.S. tax policy, moving from direct taxation toward import duties.</p>

In the private sector, IBM has announced &ldquo;a major investment in the US over the next 5 years&rdquo; [2], while Fannie Mae has reportedly &ldquo;dismantles its ESG team&rdquo; [3], indicating shifts in corporate priorities potentially responding to the changed regulatory environment.</p>
