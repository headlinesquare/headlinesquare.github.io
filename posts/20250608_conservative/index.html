<p>Anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles have escalated into violent riots, prompting the Trump administration to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to the city [1][2][3]. Reports indicate protesters have engaged in property destruction, including burning cars, with some demonstrators seen waving Mexican flags [2][4]. FBI Director Kash Patel has announced that federal authorities will pursue charges against anyone assaulting law enforcement officers during the unrest [5].</p>
<p>President Trump invoked federal authority to deploy the National Guard despite objections from California Governor Gavin Newsom [6], characterizing the governor as &ldquo;unable to handle the task.&rdquo; Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a statement regarding troop deployment, indicating the administration may mobilize Marines from Camp Pendleton if violence continues [7]. The Los Angeles Police Department has become embroiled in controversy after its statement about the anti-ICE riots [8], with reports indicating they referred to the events as &ldquo;peaceful protests&rdquo; [9].</p>
<p>The administration has characterized the situation as evidence of a migrant &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; [10], while some outlets have raised questions about who is funding the protests [11]. The White House issued a &ldquo;LAW AND ORDER&rdquo; statement in response to the unrest [12].</p>

<p>The LA riots have sparked intense political exchanges between federal and state leadership. President Trump has publicly criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass as &ldquo;incompetent,&rdquo; while implementing a ban on protesters wearing masks [13]. Multiple Republican officials have urged the President to &ldquo;put down the mob&rdquo; and swiftly end the protests [14].</p>
<p>Governor Newsom&rsquo;s office has downplayed the severity of the unrest by comparing the riots to &ldquo;sports celebrations&rdquo; [15], while Newsom himself has reportedly objected to the National Guard deployment [16]. A report claims Representative Maxine Waters made statements about Democrats wanting to &ldquo;reward illegal alien rioters with U.S. citizenship&rdquo; [17]. Representative Waters was reportedly denied access when attempting to enter an ICE detention facility [18].</p>

<p>The Trump administration has issued a formal presidential memorandum titled &ldquo;Department of Defense Security for the Protection of Department of Homeland Security Functions&rdquo; dated June 7, 2025 [21]. This document likely outlines the legal framework for military support of immigration enforcement and homeland security operations. The White House also issued an unspecified statement on the same date [22].</p>
