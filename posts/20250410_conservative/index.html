<p>President Trump has issued several executive orders addressing various issues. These include actions targeting &ldquo;risks from Chris Krebs and Government Censorship&rdquo; [1], ending union dues collection for most federal employees without notice [2], and the move to &ldquo;shut down&rdquo; what the administration has termed the government&rsquo;s &ldquo;Climate Doom Factory&rdquo; [3]. Additionally, Trump reversed Obama-Biden era regulations on showerhead water flow—calling the previous rule &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; [4]—and, amid resistance from blue states, the administration faces challenges over its DEI policies in schools [5]. Critics have characterized the administration&rsquo;s tactics as following a &ldquo;Provocation Principle&rdquo; by relying on shock and intimidation [6].</p>
