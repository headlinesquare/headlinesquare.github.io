<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)&rsquo;s plan to reform Social Security is reportedly experiencing significant difficulties, according to a Washington Post analysis that characterizes these efforts as &ldquo;backfiring&rdquo; [1].

<p>In a significant financial development, Moody&rsquo;s has downgraded the United States&rsquo; credit rating [1], removing the country from the top triple-A rating club due to rising national debt concerns [2]. This historic shift marks the end of the U.S. holding the treasured Aaa credit rating. The downgrade coincided with congressional Republicans rejecting a Trump-backed tax bill, reportedly due to spending worries related to the growing national debt [3].</p>

<h3 id="22-tariffs-and-trade-impact">2.2 Tariffs and Trade Impact</h3>
<p>President Trump has publicly confronted retailers over price increases related to his tariff policies, telling Walmart to &ldquo;eat the tariffs&rdquo; instead of raising consumer prices [1][2]. The Daily Beast reports a confrontational message from the President warning, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!&rdquo; [3]. Reports indicate Trump&rsquo;s tariff policies, characterized as a &ldquo;liberation day&rdquo; tariff assault, have reportedly &ldquo;unraveled&rdquo; within approximately 40 days of implementation [4].</p>

<h3 id="23-federal-reserve-and-tax-policy">2.3 Federal Reserve and Tax Policy</h3>
<p>Tensions between the administration and the Federal Reserve are evident as President Trump is reportedly pressuring the Fed to cut interest rates while criticizing Chair Jerome Powell [1]. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve plans to reduce its staff by 10% [2]. On tax policy, Trump&rsquo;s proposed legislation faces significant hurdles with resistance emerging from within Republican ranks [3]. The bill is being crafted to align with Trump&rsquo;s priorities, including the creation of &ldquo;MAGA accounts&rdquo; [4].</p>
