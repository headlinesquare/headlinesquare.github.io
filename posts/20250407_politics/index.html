<p>Financial markets have experienced severe turbulence following President Trump&rsquo;s global tariff implementation, with the S&amp;P 500 heading toward bear market territory[1] and the Dow plummeting over 700 points[2]. Prominent financial figures have issued warnings, with Trump supporter Bill Ackman characterizing the situation as an &ldquo;economic nuclear winter&rdquo;[3] and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warning that tariffs will boost inflation and slow the economy[4].</p>
<p>Market volatility increased when White House messaging appeared confused, with CNBC reporting officials were unaware of a supposed tariff pause[5]. Despite Wall Street opposition, President Trump has maintained his position, describing tariffs as &ldquo;a beautiful thing&rdquo; despite plunging markets[6].</p>

<p>U.S.-China trade relations have deteriorated significantly, with Trump threatening an additional 50% tariff on China in response to Beijing&rsquo;s retaliatory measures[1]. China has reportedly begun deploying rare earth minerals &ldquo;as a weapon in the trade war&rdquo;[2].</p>
<p>The European Commission has offered Trump a &ldquo;zero-for-zero&rdquo; tariffs deal on industrial goods[3], but the administration has rejected this proposal[4]. Meanwhile, the White House is considering an exporter tax credit as a counterweight to tariffs[5].</p>

<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is expanding its authority. An appeals court has restored DOGE&rsquo;s access to sensitive information at U.S. agencies[1]. DOGE is preparing for an IRS hackathon, seeking broader access to taxpayer data, which one IRS worker described as &ldquo;an open door controlled by Musk for all Americans&rsquo; most sensitive information&rdquo;[2].</p>
<p>A former DOGE employee has described the initiative as &ldquo;a wrecking ball&rdquo;[3].

<p>The administration has directed national parks to remain open despite staffing shortages[4] and has terminated a California State Library&rsquo;s $15 million federal grant[5].</p>
