<p>Marco Rubio has emerged as a trusted Trump ally receiving significant appointments [1], though Democrats have criticized him for simultaneously holding four different roles within the administration [2]. The IRS faces leadership instability with four acting leaders in a single year as Trump&rsquo;s nominee awaits confirmation [3]. Despite referring to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell as a &ldquo;Total Stiff,&rdquo; Trump has ruled out firing him [4]. Former Vice President Mike Pence will receive the Profile in Courage Award for his January 6th actions [5].</p>

<h3 id="21-doge-performance-and-budget-impacts">2.1 DOGE Performance and Budget Impacts</h3>
<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has fallen dramatically short of its ambitious targets. Initial projections of $2 trillion in government savings have been slashed to $160 billion, while DOGE&rsquo;s operating costs have reached $135 billion, resulting in net savings of just $25 billion—approximately 1.25% of the originally promised amount [1]. The presidential budget proposes $1 trillion for defense while slashing education, foreign aid, environmental programs, health services, and public assistance [2]. Trump has eliminated an agency focused on toxic chemicals and workplace hazards [3], while at least 15,000 Department of Agriculture employees have accepted voluntary resignation offers [4].</p>

<h3 id="22-tariff-policies-and-economic-consequences">2.2 Tariff Policies and Economic Consequences</h3>
<p>Economic analysts warn that America may be &ldquo;just weeks away from a mighty economic shock&rdquo; [1] as tariff policies create significant ripple effects across manufacturing and trade. Vietnam&rsquo;s factories face &ldquo;fear and uncertainty&rdquo; [2], while General Motors CEO Mary Barra announced that tariffs will cost the company up to $5 billion this year [3]. E-commerce platform Temu has halted shipments from China following Trump&rsquo;s elimination of a trade &ldquo;loophole&rdquo; [4]. The steel industry has been hit, with Cleveland Cliffs announcing plans to idle three plants in Pennsylvania and Illinois [5].</p>

<h3 id="23-consumer-and-market-impacts">2.3 Consumer and Market Impacts</h3>
<p>Automobile costs are projected to increase as tariffs on imported parts take effect [1], while online shopping platforms experience sudden price spikes [2]. Retailers describe the situation as a &ldquo;dumpster fire,&rdquo; urging consumers to buy before tariff-induced price increases [3]. President Trump has claimed credit for positive economic developments while attributing negative aspects to the previous administration, stating that the &ldquo;good parts are the Trump economy and the bad parts are the Biden economy&rdquo; [4].</p>

<p>America&rsquo;s &ldquo;long history of &lsquo;checks and balances&rsquo; is being tested by Trump like rarely before&rdquo; according to The Associated Press [1]. Civil rights advocates assert that the president&rsquo;s &ldquo;early agenda dismantles the Civil Rights Act&rdquo; while advancing &ldquo;Project 2025&rdquo; [2]. Critics have characterized certain administration health policies as promoting &ldquo;soft eugenics&rdquo; that would &ldquo;let the weak get sick&rdquo; while helping &ldquo;the clever breed&rdquo; [3]. Reproductive rights have become a focal point, with Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;baby boom policy plans&rdquo; raising concerns and earning him the label &ldquo;fertilisation president&rdquo; [4].</p>

<p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has initiated legal action against Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;board firings plan&rdquo; [1]. Critics characterize these moves as an &ldquo;assault on PBS and NPR&rdquo; that prioritizes &ldquo;oligarchy over press freedom&rdquo; [2]. The National Endowment for the Arts has been hit with substantial cuts after the administration called for the agency&rsquo;s elimination [3], resulting in the termination of dozens of grants [4].
