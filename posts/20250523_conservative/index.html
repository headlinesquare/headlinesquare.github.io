<p>President Trump has announced major tariff measures against both the European Union and Apple. The administration has threatened 50% tariffs on European Union goods [1] and a 25% tariff on Apple&rsquo;s iPhones unless they are manufactured in the United States [1, 2].

<p>The Spectator has published an analysis suggesting that the &ldquo;EU could pay a high price for not settling with Trump&rdquo; [4].

<p>A Colombian national in Massachusetts has been accused of voting illegally in the 2024 election and receiving more than $400,000 in fraudulently obtained federal benefits [5]. Additionally, a significant administrative cleanup of Social Security records has reportedly resulted in 12.3 million deceased individuals being properly marked as deceased in the system [6].</p>
