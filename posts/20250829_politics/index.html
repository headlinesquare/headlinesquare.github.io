DAILY BRIEFING
1. The Executive Branch: Unilateral Actions and Institutional Turmoil 1.1 Executive vs. Legislative: The Budget and Foreign Aid Crisis A major constitutional conflict over the power of the purse has erupted, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a government shutdown. The Trump administration has moved to unilaterally cancel between $4.9 billion and $5 billion in foreign aid previously approved by lawmakers, using a rare “pocket rescission” maneuver not seen in nearly 50 years to achieve the cancellation [1, 2]. The move is widely viewed as an “end-run around Congress’ funding power” [3]. In response, congressional sources are reportedly bracing for a shutdown, directly linking the fiscal confrontation to an imminent crisis [4]. In a related development, the administration has handed off the “closeout” of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, signaling a major structural shift in foreign aid administration [5].">

<h3 id="11-executive-vs-legislative-the-budget-and-foreign-aid-crisis">1.1 Executive vs. Legislative: The Budget and Foreign Aid Crisis</h3>
<p>A major constitutional conflict over the power of the purse has erupted, dramatically increasing the likelihood of a government shutdown. The Trump administration has moved to unilaterally cancel between $4.9 billion and $5 billion in foreign aid previously approved by lawmakers, using a rare &ldquo;pocket rescission&rdquo; maneuver not seen in nearly 50 years to achieve the cancellation [1, 2]. The move is widely viewed as an &ldquo;end-run around Congress&rsquo; funding power&rdquo; [3]. In response, congressional sources are reportedly bracing for a shutdown, directly linking the fiscal confrontation to an imminent crisis [4]. In a related development, the administration has handed off the &ldquo;closeout&rdquo; of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, signaling a major structural shift in foreign aid administration [5].</p>

<p>Federal agencies are experiencing significant upheaval as the administration moves to assert political control over bodies &ldquo;long seen as above politics,&rdquo; such as the Federal Reserve and the CDC [1]. The dismissal of the CDC Director drew rare bipartisan pushback, leading to resignations, including the C.D.C.’s Vaccine Chief who stated quitting was his &ldquo;only option&rdquo; [2]. The administration is now moving to appoint Jim O’Neill to bolster HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&rsquo;s agenda to &ldquo;remake vaccine policy&rdquo; [3]. In a parallel move, a fired Federal Reserve board member, identified as Lisa Cook, has filed a lawsuit against President Trump to retain her position [4]. In the intelligence community, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard reportedly revealed the identity of an undercover officer in a &ldquo;major flub&rdquo; [5].</p>

<h3 id="13-domestic-security-and-federal-law-enforcement">1.3 Domestic Security and Federal Law Enforcement</h3>
<p>The executive branch is taking assertive and controversial actions in domestic security. President Trump has officially revoked the Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris, a detail that had been extended via an &ldquo;undisclosed Biden order&rdquo; [1]. Concurrently, the President has threatened to deploy more National Guard troops into U.S. cities, prompting Illinois Governor Pritzker to state that federal &ldquo;action will be met with a response&rdquo; regarding a potential deployment to Chicago [2]. In Washington, D.C., the administration is touting a &ldquo;capital crime crackdown&rdquo; after a 12-day period without a murder, while also drawing criticism for an associated death penalty pledge described as &ldquo;ugly racial politics&rdquo; [3, 4].</p>

<p>A federal appeals court has dealt a major legal blow to the administration, ruling that President Trump&rsquo;s sweeping global tariffs are unconstitutional because the policy &ldquo;overstepped presidential powers&rdquo; [1]. However, in a decision creating significant economic and legal uncertainty, the court has left the tariffs in place &ldquo;for now,&rdquo; pending a near-certain appeal to the Supreme Court [2]. In a separate ruling, the same court blocked the President’s &ldquo;&lsquo;Liberation Day&rsquo; orders,&rdquo; also deeming them illegal [3].</p>
