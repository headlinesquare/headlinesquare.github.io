<p>The Trump administration continues reshaping federal policy through executive orders [1] while targeting specific institutions for funding cuts. The administration is moving to cancel approximately $100 million in federal contracts with Harvard University [2], with Trump describing the school as &ldquo;very antisemitic&rdquo; [3]. President Trump has also threatened to redirect $3 billion in federal grants from Harvard to trade schools [4] and to withhold California&rsquo;s federal funding over a transgender athlete issue [5].</p>
<p>NPR and Colorado public radio stations have filed legal action against the Trump White House over an executive order cutting federal funding [6]. The Government Accountability Office has ruled that the Transportation Department cannot withhold funds from the electric vehicle infrastructure program [7], and New York has won a bid to stop the U.S. from freezing funds in a congestion pricing dispute [8].</p>

<p>Russia has announced a prisoner exchange agreement with President Trump [1], while the administration is considering imposing new sanctions against Russia according to Wall Street Journal reporting [2]. Military tensions with Russia are intensifying as the U.S. reinforces Europe&rsquo;s northern front amid fears of a wider conflict [3].</p>
<p>President Trump has presented contradictory messages: admitting he has &ldquo;no way to make Putin stop&rdquo; as bombs fall on Kyiv [4], while also warning Putin he is &ldquo;playing with fire&rdquo; [5] and claiming he has protected Russia from &ldquo;really bad things&rdquo; [6]. These remarks have drawn criticism from Russian media [7], and Republicans are reportedly putting pressure on Trump over Russia, with one quoted saying &ldquo;Putin has been jerking us around&rdquo; [8].</p>
