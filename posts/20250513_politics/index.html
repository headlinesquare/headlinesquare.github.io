1. Trump Administration and Presidential Ethics 1.1 Qatar Jet Controversy and Ethics Concerns The Trump administration faces intense scrutiny over a plan to accept a free Boeing 747 jet from Qatar to replace Air Force One. President Trump defended this decision, stating it would be “stupid” to reject free gifts [1], though the aircraft is reportedly worth approximately $400 million [2]. The proposed arrangement has raised substantial ethical concerns, with former White House ethics lawyers characterizing it as an Emoluments Clause violation [3]. Security experts describe the plane as a potential “security nightmare” [4], with reports indicating conversion for Air Force One use would be “impossible” until after 2028 and would require hundreds of millions in additional costs [5].">
