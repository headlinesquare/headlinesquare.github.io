<p>House Democrats have raised concerns that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is building a &ldquo;master database&rdquo; of Americans&rsquo; sensitive information [1]. A DOGE representative has reportedly verbally abused federal workers on a 36-hour shift [2].

<p>The Supreme Court has temporarily halted deportations of Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act [1] [2], marking a significant judicial check on the administration&rsquo;s use of this 18th century wartime law. The administration responded by characterizing the litigation as &ldquo;meritless&rdquo; [3]. The Court is also set to hear challenges to the Affordable Care Act&rsquo;s preventive care mandate [4] and arguments on Trump&rsquo;s attempt to reinterpret the 14th Amendment regarding birthright citizenship [5].</p>

Senator Van Hollen returned from El Salvador stating the case &ldquo;is about far more than one man&rdquo; [1], reporting that Abrego Garcia is &ldquo;traumatized&rdquo; by prison threats [2]. Trump has distanced himself from direct involvement despite reportedly &ldquo;paying&rdquo; El Salvador to imprison him [3]. The ACLU has warned the Supreme Court that more deportation flights are &ldquo;imminent&rdquo; [4].</p>
