<h3 id="11-performance-assessment-and-public-opinion">1.1 Performance Assessment and Public Opinion</h3>
<p>President Trump&rsquo;s first 100 days have generated predominantly negative polling data. Only 39% approve of his economic handling [1], while most Americans view him as &ldquo;a dangerous dictator&rdquo; [2]. His popularity has hit &ldquo;historic lows&rdquo; [3], with a significant plurality assigning him an &ldquo;F&rdquo; grade—more than any other grade [4]. Financial markets are experiencing their worst 100-day start since Nixon due to &ldquo;semi-permanent uncertainty&rdquo; [5].</p>
<p>The President has rejected negative polling as &ldquo;FAKE&rdquo; [6] while claiming &ldquo;I Run the Country and the World&rdquo; [7]. The Wall Street Journal characterizes Trump 2.0 as &ldquo;in trouble&rdquo; [8], while multiple analyses catalog &ldquo;the most consequential, damaging, head-scratching things Trump did in his first 100 days&rdquo; [9].</p>

<h3 id="12-executive-actions-and-policy-implementation">1.2 Executive Actions and Policy Implementation</h3>
<p>President Trump has issued numerous executive orders reflecting what Fox News terms an &ldquo;unprecedented use of presidential authority&rdquo; [1]. Key directives include requiring truck drivers to speak English [2], implementing auto industry tariffs [3], and targeting sanctuary cities while authorizing military involvement in domestic law enforcement [4].</p>
<p>The administration has set a July 4 deadline for Trump&rsquo;s tax agenda [5] while spending approximately $220 billion more in the first 100 days than the previous year, despite promises of fiscal restraint [6]. The White House has used government powers against more than 100 perceived enemies [7].

<h3 id="21-doge-operations-and-conflicts">2.1 DOGE Operations and Conflicts</h3>
<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) faces significant scrutiny. A Senate report values Musk&rsquo;s conflicts of interest at $2.37 billion [1], warning he may leverage governmental influence to avoid legal liability. Despite Musk&rsquo;s mission to reduce government size, federal spending has increased by $171 billion over prior years [2]. Reports indicate Musk has lost approximately 25% of his fortune during his government role [3].</p>
<p>DOGE&rsquo;s impact is becoming visible across agencies. The Peace Corps faces &ldquo;significant&rdquo; cuts following a DOGE assessment [4], with state-level impacts described as &ldquo;devastating&rdquo; in Wyoming regarding AmeriCorps [5]. A new lawsuit directly challenges President Trump and DOGE&rsquo;s government overhaul plans [6], with top Democrats claiming the administration has disrupted approximately $430 billion in federal funds [7].</p>
