DAILY BRIEFING
1. Economic &amp; Fiscal Policy 1.1 Federal Reserve Holds Interest Rates Amid Presidential Pressure The Federal Reserve has maintained its key interest rate at its current level, marking the fifth consecutive meeting without a change [1]. This decision is being widely reported as a direct defiance of the White House, as it follows public calls from President Trump for rate cuts [2]. The President, celebrating a recent rebound in national GDP, had explicitly demanded that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell lower interest rates to fuel further economic momentum [3]. The ongoing tension between the administration’s growth-focused agenda and the Federal Reserve’s independent monetary policy remains a primary point of friction in federal economic management.">

<p>The U.S. economy registered a 3.0% growth rate in the second quarter, a figure noted in multiple reports as having surpassed analyst expectations [1]. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent framed the current economic situation as a turnaround from the previous administration, under which he asserted the &ldquo;bottom 50% got crushed.&rdquo; Bessent stated the current administration&rsquo;s comeback strategy is centered on increasing wages for working Americans while getting inflation under control [2].</p>

<h3 id="13-fiscal-oversight-and-government-spending">1.3 Fiscal Oversight and Government Spending</h3>
<p>A legislative effort to ban stock trading by members of Congress has successfully advanced through committee. Senator Josh Hawley, a proponent of the bill, has publicly denied reports alleging that the White House pushed back against the measure [1]. Separately, a new report from Senator Joni Ernst’s office claims taxpayers are liable for $163 billion in delayed infrastructure projects nationwide, a problem far exceeding the scope of the California high-speed rail project [2]. Further scrutiny of federal expenditures has reportedly revealed that millions of individuals are currently double-enrolled in different taxpayer-funded health coverage plans [3].</p>

<p>In a significant trade policy development, President Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on India.

<p>A potentially major development is unfolding at FBI Headquarters. FBI Director Kash Patel has reportedly discovered thousands of sensitive documents related to the origins of the Trump-Russia &ldquo;Crossfire Hurricane&rdquo; investigation [1]. According to sources cited in multiple reports, these documents were found inside &ldquo;burn bags&rdquo; in what is being described as a &ldquo;secret room&rdquo; within the bureau [2]. While this internal discovery is developing, other reports indicate that newly declassified documents have emerged which appear to contradict several statements made to Congress by former CIA Director John Brennan [3]. Concurrently, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is reportedly using a century-old law to press the DOJ and FBI for the release of files pertaining to Jeffrey Epstein [4].</p>

<p>The Senate has confirmed Emil Bove to a judgeship on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, a confirmation portrayed in some media as a significant accomplishment for the administration against Democratic opposition [1]. The confirmation vote occurred amidst public criticism from President Trump regarding what he labeled an &ldquo;‘Unconstitutional’ Senate Custom,&rdquo; which he claims is being exploited by Democrats to stall his judicial nominees [2].</p>

<p>The DOJ and FBI are now investigating a brutal group assault in Cincinnati that was captured in a viral video, elevating a local incident to federal attention [1]. A point of public contention in the case is the report that a suspect had been previously released on just a $400 bond despite facing four separate felony charges [2]. Other high-profile violent crimes reported include a Virginia Councilman being doused in gasoline and set on fire outside his office, for which a suspect has been arrested [3].</p>

<p>The Trump administration&rsquo;s Department of Homeland Security has launched a public ad campaign with the stated goal of urging illegal aliens to self-deport [1]. This is accompanied by a more targeted policy to counter &ldquo;birth tourism,&rdquo; specifically aiming to prevent Nigerian nationals from entering the country for the primary purpose of giving birth to secure U.S. citizenship for their children [2].
