In domestic politics, the upset victory of a progressive candidate in the New York City mayoral primary has sent shockwaves through both parties, creating deep turmoil within the Democratic establishment and providing a new line of attack for Republicans.">

<p>In a watershed decision, the Supreme Court has ruled that states have the authority to block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers [1]. The ruling, which upheld a South Carolina law, effectively negates what was previously understood as a patient&rsquo;s &lsquo;right&rsquo; for Medicaid recipients to choose their own medical provider [2]. The decision drew a forceful dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who wrote that the Court is actively &ldquo;stymying&rdquo; civil rights and stripping recipients of &ldquo;a deeply personal freedom: the ‘ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable’&rdquo; [3].</p>

<h3 id="12-other-major-legal-developments">1.2 Other Major Legal Developments</h3>
<p>The Supreme Court is set to issue rulings on six other cases on the final day of its term, most notably a case concerning the future of birthright citizenship [1]. In an unprecedented legal maneuver, the Trump administration has taken the step of suing every federal judge in the state of Maryland over a court order that blocked the administration&rsquo;s efforts to remove certain immigrants [2]. In a separate matter, Kenneth Chesebro, identified as the &ldquo;architect&rdquo; of the pro-Trump 2020 &ldquo;fake elector scheme,&rdquo; has been formally disbarred in New York for misconduct that a judicial panel concluded undercut &ldquo;the very notion of our constitutional democracy&rdquo; [3].</p>

<h3 id="21-gop-big-beautiful-bill-fails-in-senate">2.1 GOP &ldquo;Big, Beautiful Bill&rdquo; Fails in Senate</h3>
<p>The Republican majority’s signature legislative package has collapsed, throwing the administration&rsquo;s fiscal agenda into disarray. The Senate Parliamentarian dealt a &ldquo;huge blow&rdquo; to the effort by ruling that its proposed cuts to Medicaid—designed to offset trillions in tax breaks—do not comply with the Byrd Rule for budget reconciliation [1]. In a decisive move, Senate Majority Leader John Thune announced he will not use his authority to overrule the &ldquo;Senate referee&rdquo; on the matter, effectively blocking the provision from the fast-track process and jeopardizing the entire bill [2]. This comes as the Congressional Budget Office had already determined the House-passed version of the bill would add trillions to the national debt, even when accounting for projected economic growth [3].</p>
<p>[1] Senate Parliamentarian Deals Huge Blow To Critical Part Of GOP&rsquo;s ‘Big Beautiful Bill&rsquo;, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/parliamentarian-medicaid-cuts-provider-tax_n_685d4229e4b0f78c573833aa?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_campaign=us_main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer ">https://www.huffpost.com/entry/parliamentarian-medicaid-cuts-provider-tax_n_685d4229e4b0f78c573833aa?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=reddit&utm_campaign=us_main</a><br>

<h3 id="22-political-fallout-and-intra-party-fissures">2.2 Political Fallout and Intra-Party Fissures</h3>
<p>The legislative failure has triggered significant political backlash, with reports of a &ldquo;MAGA Revolt&rdquo; against President Trump over the bill&rsquo;s collapse as Republican leadership &ldquo;scrambles&rdquo; for alternatives [1]. The proposed cuts had already faced significant internal resistance, with multiple GOP senators &ldquo;pushing back hard&rdquo; against them [2]. In a separate criticism, former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell labeled the administration &ldquo;unnecessarily chaotic&rdquo; while making the politically risky claim that voters will &ldquo;get over&rdquo; losing Medicaid benefits [3].</p>

<h3 id="31-iran-crisis-intel-leaks-admin-fury-and-a-diplomatic-overture">3.1 Iran Crisis: Intel Leaks, Admin Fury, and a Diplomatic Overture</h3>
<p>The situation surrounding recent U.S. strikes on Iran is highly volatile, characterized by conflicting intelligence, a major leak, and a surprise diplomatic maneuver.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conflicting Assessments &amp; Intel Leak:</strong> A major public dispute has erupted over the results of the strikes. While Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard stated &ldquo;new intelligence&rdquo; confirms the destruction of Iranian facilities, this conflicts with early European intelligence assessments indicating Iran&rsquo;s uranium stockpile remains &ldquo;largely intact&rdquo; [1, 2]. This has been compounded by a significant intelligence leak, which has reportedly &ldquo;enraged&rdquo; President Trump and led to DNI Gabbard being dropped from a key intelligence briefing [3].</li>
<li><strong>White House Reaction:</strong> Both the President and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth are described as &ldquo;melting down&rdquo; over the leaks and have furiously lashed out at the media coverage [4]. In a direct attack, President Trump publicly called for the firing of a CNN reporter over her story on the strikes, stating she should be &ldquo;thrown out like a dog&rdquo; [5].</li>

A new vaccine panel he leads has called &ldquo;all childhood vaccines in question&rdquo; [1]. The panel also issued a &ldquo;shock&rdquo; vote to endorse only preservative-free flu shots, a move U.S. pediatricians immediately labeled &ldquo;truly an embarrassment&rdquo; [2]. Kennedy&rsquo;s decision to halt U.S. funding for the Gavi vaccine alliance has led public health experts to warn that he will be &ldquo;<code>personally responsible</code>&rdquo; for future children&rsquo;s deaths [3].

<p>The Republican response has been swift and aggressive. President Trump attacked Mamdani as a &ldquo;&lsquo;100% Communist Lunatic&rsquo;&rdquo; [1]. Some far-right groups and a sitting GOP congressman have issued what have been described as &ldquo;Islamophobic&rdquo; calls for Mamdani&rsquo;s citizenship to be revoked and for his deportation [2]. Strategists are already seeking to &ldquo;tie vulnerable Dems to Mamdani&rdquo; in upcoming elections [3]. In broader political analysis, a Pew Research Center study of validated voters from the 2024 election concludes that President Trump&rsquo;s victory was supported by a &ldquo;more racially and ethnically diverse voter coalition&rdquo; than in his previous campaigns [4].</p>

This is coupled with a drop in U.S. consumer confidence and reports that college graduates are facing the &ldquo;toughest job market in more than a decade&rdquo; [2, 3]. The U.S. dollar has fallen to a three-year low, a drop linked to reports that President Trump may name his choice for the next Federal Reserve chair early in a bid to undermine Jerome Powell [4]. Separately, new figures show the U.S. merchandise-trade deficit &ldquo;unexpectedly&rdquo; widened after goods exports tumbled by the most since 2020, with the President&rsquo;s tariffs cited as a disrupting factor [5].</p>
