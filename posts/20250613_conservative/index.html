<p>Iran has launched retaliatory strikes against Tel Aviv, with reports of &ldquo;significant damage&rdquo; to the city [1]. The United States is reportedly helping to shoot down Iranian missiles during these retaliatory strikes [1]. The commercial impact of the conflict is evident as &ldquo;Airlines are avoiding 4 countries after Israel&rsquo;s airstrikes on Iran&rdquo; [2].

<p>The U.S. government has maintained diplomatic distance while supporting Israel. Secretary of State Rubio explicitly stated that &ldquo;Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes … Iran should not target U.S. interests or personnel&rdquo; [1]. However, reports indicate Israel coordinated with the U.S. before conducting the strikes [2]. Senate Majority Leader Schumer has emphasized that America&rsquo;s commitment to Israel &ldquo;Must Be &lsquo;Ironclad&rsquo;&rdquo; according to the Wall Street Journal [3].</p>
<p>President Trump has expressed approval of Israel&rsquo;s military actions, describing the attack as &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; [4] and suggesting that additional operations may follow [5]. Trump also claimed he had previously offered Iran&rsquo;s leaders a diplomatic solution, stating that they did not heed his warnings [6] and are now &ldquo;all dead&rdquo; [7].</p>

<p>The Trump administration has initiated a major deportation action targeting approximately 500,000 immigrants who are being ordered to leave the United States [1]. According to reports, this policy involves stripping legal status from over half a million migrants who are being told to &ldquo;self deport&rdquo; [2]. The Republican-controlled House has passed legislation targeting Washington D.C.&rsquo;s sanctuary city policies with a vote of 224-194, including support from 11 Democrats [3]. The House has also passed a rescissions bill that includes what are described as &ldquo;massive spending cuts&rdquo; [4].</p>

<h3 id="22-anti-ice-protests-and-law-enforcement-responses">2.2 Anti-ICE Protests and Law Enforcement Responses</h3>
<p>Investigations have been launched into the funding of &ldquo;anti-ICE riots&rdquo; following reports of &ldquo;numerous high budget requests&rdquo; allegedly made for &ldquo;paid agitators&rdquo; [1]. Florida officials have issued warnings against potential riots in response to President Trump&rsquo;s immigration crackdown, stating firmly &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not California&rdquo; [2]. In Portland, &ldquo;Protesters set fires near Portland ICE building, 10 arrested&rdquo; [3]. Law enforcement operations have been disrupted by protesters in multiple jurisdictions, with one headline describing a &ldquo;Massive drug bust impeded by protesters &rsquo;thinking it was an ICE raid,&rsquo; sheriff says: &lsquo;Idiots&rsquo;&rdquo; [4]. Tensions between local and federal authorities over immigration enforcement are evident, with one report describing how a &ldquo;Police Chief Schools LA Councilwoman After She Asks Him to Interfere With ICE Raids&rdquo; [5].</p>

<h3 id="31-national-guard-deployment-legal-battle">3.1 National Guard Deployment Legal Battle</h3>
<p>A significant legal battle has erupted over President Trump&rsquo;s deployment of the National Guard to address protests in Los Angeles. A federal judge, identified as Judge Breyer, ruled that Trump &ldquo;illegally deployed National Guard to help with LA protests&rdquo; [1] and ordered control be returned to California authorities [2]. However, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals quickly intervened, granting an &ldquo;administrative stay&rdquo; of this ruling [3], temporarily allowing the president to maintain control of the National Guard forces while a three-judge panel considers the case [4, 5]. One headline characterized the appeals court decision as &ldquo;Appeals Court Humiliates Newsom, Restores Trump&rsquo;s Control of National Guard&rdquo; [6].</p>
