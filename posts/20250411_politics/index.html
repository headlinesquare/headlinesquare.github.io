<p>A Louisiana immigration judge has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, can be deported [1], representing a significant test of the administration&rsquo;s deportation powers. Simultaneously, the Supreme Court has demanded &ldquo;daily updates&rdquo; regarding compliance with court orders to return a Maryland man wrongfully deported to El Salvador [2], with a judge characterizing the deportation as &ldquo;wholly illegal from the moment it happened&rdquo; [3]. A federal judge has sided with Trump in allowing immigration enforcement in houses of worship [4].</p>

<p>The administration has launched a strategy to force immigrants to leave by manipulating federal systems. Multiple sources confirm the administration is placing thousands of living immigrants in Social Security&rsquo;s &ldquo;death master file&rdquo; [1], effectively canceling their Social Security numbers to cut off financial services. The Department of Homeland Security has directed migrants who entered through the CBP One app to &ldquo;leave immediately&rdquo; [2], while the administration has terminated protected status for thousands of Afghans and Cameroonians [3].</p>

Tennessee&rsquo;s Senate has voted to allow school districts to deny enrollment to undocumented students [3]. Contradictorily, President Trump has proposed allowing undocumented farm and hotel workers to work legally in the U.S. [4], while a GOP Florida Congresswoman has opposed deportations for migrants fleeing authoritarian regimes [5].</p>

<p>Financial markets show severe stress, with liquidity worsening in the $29 trillion Treasury market amid soaring volatility [1]. U.S. Treasury bonds now trade like risky investments [2], with a troubling &ldquo;freak sell-off&rdquo; unsettling Wall Street [3]. Despite Trump&rsquo;s insistence that the &ldquo;tariff war is doing really well&rdquo; [4], BlackRock&rsquo;s CEO has stated the U.S. &ldquo;may already be in recession&rdquo; [5]. Consumer sentiment has reached historic lows, with one measure showing the second-lowest level on records dating back to 1952 [6].</p>

<h3 id="22-us-china-tariff-escalation">2.2 U.S.-China Tariff Escalation</h3>
<p>The U.S.-China trade war has reached unprecedented levels. China has raised tariffs on U.S. goods to 125% from 84% [1], with Bloomberg reporting China &ldquo;Says It Won&rsquo;t Go Higher&rdquo; [2]. Implementation challenges persist, with reports of a technical &ldquo;glitch&rdquo; resulting in no one at ports collecting the tariffs [3], though Trump tariff surcharges are now being added to customer bills [4]. Congressional leaders including Senators Warren and Schumer are calling for SEC investigations into possible market manipulation related to tariff announcements [5].</p>
