NASA faces significant budget reductions [3], while coal miners in West Virginia have lost access to black lung screenings after cuts to worker safety agency NIOSH [4]. The Energy Star program faces elimination after three decades [5], and Bill Gates has publicly accused Elon Musk of &ldquo;killing&rdquo; children through USAID cuts [6].</p>

<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) faces challenges gaining traction with lawmakers [1]. Reports indicate public land agencies depleted by DOGE will rely more heavily on private partners [2]. The Trump administration is reportedly pressuring nations subject to U.S. tariffs to approve Musk&rsquo;s Starlink service [3], while tensions between tech leaders are escalating, with Bill Gates reportedly accusing Musk of &ldquo;killing the world&rsquo;s poorest children&rdquo; [4].</p>

<h3 id="21-tariffs-and-international-trade">2.1 Tariffs and International Trade</h3>
<p>The administration&rsquo;s tariff policies are creating significant economic tensions. China has explicitly called for the U.S. to cancel tariffs ahead of planned trade talks [1], while Americans are reporting tangible effects of tariffs through higher prices [2]. President Trump has characterized 10% as only the minimum tariff rate, with some potentially being &ldquo;much higher&rdquo; [3] and has stated that tariffs slowing down ports is a &ldquo;good thing&rdquo; [4]. The administration has announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom [5], though economic experts have expressed skepticism about its benefits. The European Union has announced approximately €100 billion in countermeasures targeting U.S. planes and automobiles [6].</p>
