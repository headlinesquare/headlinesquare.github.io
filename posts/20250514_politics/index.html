<p>Six months after its establishment, Elon Musk&rsquo;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) faces critical evaluation.

A Musk adviser &ldquo;may make as much as $1 million a year while helping to dismantle&rdquo; agencies that regulate Musk&rsquo;s own companies [3]. Members of DOGE&rsquo;s Treasury team have disclosed bank stock holdings that critics characterize as a &ldquo;glaring red flag&rdquo; for potential conflicts of interest [4]. Federal employees affected by DOGE-initiated reductions continue organized resistance, gathering &ldquo;in Capitol for 10th time&rdquo; to urge Congress to reverse the cuts [5].</p>
