<h3 id="13-department-of-government-efficiency-doge">1.3 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</h3>
<p>Six months after its establishment, Elon Musk&rsquo;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) faces critical evaluation. Financial analysis shows the department has &ldquo;yet to find a fraction of the hoped for savings&rdquo; [1], with reports that it is &ldquo;falling spectacularly short&rdquo; of targets [2]. A Musk adviser &ldquo;may make as much as $1 million a year while helping to dismantle&rdquo; agencies that regulate Musk&rsquo;s own companies [3]. Members of DOGE&rsquo;s Treasury team have disclosed bank stock holdings that critics characterize as a &ldquo;glaring red flag&rdquo; for potential conflicts of interest [4]. Federal employees affected by DOGE-initiated reductions continue organized resistance, gathering &ldquo;in Capitol for 10th time&rdquo; to urge Congress to reverse the cuts [5].</p>
