<h3 id="21-doge-and-big-beautiful-bill-conflicts">2.1 DOGE and &ldquo;Big Beautiful Bill&rdquo; Conflicts</h3>
<p>Significant tensions have emerged between President Trump and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk over economic policy. Musk has publicly expressed disappointment with Trump&rsquo;s tax legislation, which the President has called a &ldquo;big, beautiful bill&rdquo; [1][2]. Musk claims the legislation undermines DOGE&rsquo;s mission [3], with Financial Times reporting this as his &ldquo;strongest rebuke of US president&rsquo;s agenda yet&rdquo; [4].</p>
<p>The bill has created divisions within Republican ranks, with Senator Ron Johnson stating there are &ldquo;enough&rdquo; Republican votes to potentially block it [5]. An unnamed GOP Senator has criticized the legislation, claiming it will &ldquo;bankrupt American&rdquo; and insisting &ldquo;it has to stop&rdquo; [6]. One Nebraska Representative admitted voting for the bill without knowing its contents [7].</p>
<p>DOGE faces legal challenges. A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit challenging the constitutional legitimacy of DOGE and Musk&rsquo;s authority can proceed [8], while another judicial ruling grants DOGE access to sensitive Treasury payment systems and data [9].</p>
