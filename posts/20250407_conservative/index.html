<p>President Trump is pursuing an aggressive tariff strategy, particularly targeting China with threats of additional 50% tariffs if Beijing doesn&rsquo;t eliminate retaliatory measures [1][2]. The President has indicated he would veto any legislation attempting to limit his tariff authority [3] and is reportedly unwilling to compromise with China unless the trade deficit issue is resolved [4]. Despite market volatility in response [5], Trump has characterized tariffs as a &ldquo;beautiful thing to behold&rdquo; and warned against being what he termed a &ldquo;Panican&rdquo; party of &ldquo;weak and stupid people&rdquo; [6]. Administration officials have publicly defended these policies in sometimes contentious media appearances [7].</p>

<p>A complex legal battle has emerged over an individual&rsquo;s deportation to El Salvador, with Chief Justice Roberts intervening to pause the deadline for the person&rsquo;s return to the United States [1][2].
