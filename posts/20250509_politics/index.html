<h3 id="31-tariffs-and-global-trade">3.1 Tariffs and Global Trade</h3>
<p>President Trump has suggested an 80% tariff on Chinese imports [1] while delegating final decisions to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent [2]. The administration confirmed that a baseline 10% tariff will remain permanent [3] and identified approximately 20 priority economies for trade negotiations [4]. The U.S.-UK trade deal reducing tariffs on cars and metals [5] has generated criticism from American automakers [6]. Economic impacts are mounting: China&rsquo;s exports to the U.S. have dropped 20% [7], businesses are labeling tariff costs on receipts [8], and consumers face higher prices on products ranging from vehicles to baby items [9].</p>
