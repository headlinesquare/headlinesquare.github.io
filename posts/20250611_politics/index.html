<p>The Trump administration has intensified immigration enforcement nationwide, with ICE conducting raids across multiple states including California agricultural communities [1].

The administration plans to send thousands of migrants to Guantanamo to &ldquo;free up&rdquo; space at detention facilities, according to reports [3].</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s border czar Tom Homan has expressed concern that ongoing protests are making immigration raids more &ldquo;difficult&rdquo; and &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; for ICE agents [4]. National Guard troops are specifically protecting ICE agents as they make arrests in Los Angeles [5]. A specific case drawing significant attention involves asylum-seeker Andry Hernández Romero, with hundreds of protesters gathered at the Supreme Court demanding the Trump administration &ldquo;return&rdquo; the reportedly &ldquo;disappeared gay asylum-seeker&rdquo; [6].</p>
