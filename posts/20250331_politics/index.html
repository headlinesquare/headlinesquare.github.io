<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has accessed the federal payroll system despite objections from career IT officials, who were subsequently placed on leave and under investigation [1]. A DOGE staffer who previously shared Treasury Department data now has expanded access to government systems [2]. While leading DOGE, Musk claimed his government role is &ldquo;costing me a lot&rdquo; [3] while simultaneously stating that public backlash against DOGE&rsquo;s cuts is negatively affecting Tesla stock [4]. DOGE&rsquo;s actions have disrupted Social Security service delivery [5].</p>

<p>The White House has taken controversial personnel actions, including the &ldquo;highly unusual step&rdquo; of directly firing line prosecutors [1] and reportedly ordering the termination of a prosecutor investigating one of the president&rsquo;s donors [2]. A new FDA commissioner has ousted a top vaccine regulator after a private swearing-in ceremony [3]. On internal communications, the White House has declared the Signal group chat review &ldquo;case closed&rdquo; [4], despite growing Republican calls for investigation into Trump officials&rsquo; Signal chat usage [5].</p>

<h3 id="21-tariff-implementation--global-reactions">2.1 Tariff Implementation &amp; Global Reactions</h3>
<p>President Trump is implementing sweeping tariff policies set to take effect on April 2, described as &ldquo;Liberation Day,&rdquo; which will &ldquo;start with all countries&rdquo; [1]. These policies have prompted Americans to reduce spending in anticipation of price increases [2]. The New York Times reports that &ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s Tariff Agenda Bets on Americans Giving Up Cheap Goods&rdquo; [3]. China, Japan, and South Korea plan to jointly respond to U.S. tariffs [4], while Canada has implemented &ldquo;Buy Canadian&rdquo; practices turning away U.S. products [5]. The White House is considering providing financial assistance to affected farmers [6].</p>

<h3 id="22-market-performance--recession-concerns">2.2 Market Performance &amp; Recession Concerns</h3>
<p>Financial markets have reacted sharply to the tariff announcements, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq falling to six-month lows [1] and stocks marking their worst month in years [2]. Goldman Sachs has revised its U.S. recession probability upward from 20% to 35% [3], while first-quarter GDP growth is projected at just 0.3% as tariffs contribute to stagflation conditions [4]. Consumer confidence about the future has reached a 12-year low, prompting companies to lower earnings forecasts [5].
