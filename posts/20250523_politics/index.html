<p>President Trump is set to sign orders to boost nuclear power as early as Friday [1]. The administration hosted a &ldquo;memecoin contest&rdquo; dinner that drew bipartisan criticism for allegedly selling access to the president [2], generating $148 million amid distribution of $100,000 gem-encrusted watches [3]. Elon Musk&rsquo;s Department of Government Efficiency is expanding his Grok AI system throughout government operations, raising conflict of interest concerns [4].

<p>President Trump has threatened sweeping new tariffs, including 50% duties on European Union imports [1] and 25% penalties on Apple products not manufactured in the United States [2]. He justified the EU tariff decision by claiming trade talks were &ldquo;going nowhere&rdquo; [3]. These actions triggered significant market disruptions, described by analysts as a &ldquo;scorched earth trade war&rdquo; [4]. Puerto Rico is actively pursuing manufacturing facilities displaced by escalating trade tensions [5].</p>

<p>The Trump administration has cut scientific research funding to its lowest level in decades [1]. States have been forced to cancel millions in rural broadband investments following the administration&rsquo;s termination of the Digital Equity Act, reportedly because the legislation contained the word &ldquo;equity&rdquo; [2]. Moody&rsquo;s downgrade has intensified investor concerns about the U.S. fiscal trajectory [3].</p>
