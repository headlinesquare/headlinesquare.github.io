<p>President Trump&rsquo;s approval ratings have surged to 55% according to InsiderAdvantage [1], a development attributed to his recent Middle East diplomatic trip. This positive trend is confirmed by three additional polls showing strong approval numbers [2]. Economic sentiment has dramatically shifted, with a majority of voters now describing the economy as &ldquo;strong&rdquo; for the first time in nearly four years [3]. Polling also indicates voters believe Trump is more effective at &ldquo;protecting the Constitution&rdquo; than his predecessor [4].</p>
