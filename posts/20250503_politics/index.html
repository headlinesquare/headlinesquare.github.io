<h3 id="11-presidential-actions--administration-structure">1.1 Presidential Actions &amp; Administration Structure</h3>
<p>The Trump administration is pursuing significant government restructuring, planning to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts [1] and reduce EPA staffing to Reagan-era levels [2]. The White House has launched an unusual continuous video stream highlighting administration accomplishments [3] and begun holding &ldquo;influencer briefings&rdquo; featuring conspiracy theorists and former officials [4].</p>
<p>President Trump&rsquo;s communication style continues to draw attention, including posting AI-generated images of himself as the pope [5], making controversial statements about transgender athletes [6], and labeling political opponents as &ldquo;communists&rdquo; [7]. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene claims the administration is &ldquo;losing the base&rdquo; [8], while Secretary of State Marco Rubio has rapidly gained influence [9]. National Security Adviser Waltz was dismissed following coordination with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding Iran military options that reportedly angered President Trump [10].</p>

<h3 id="12-doge-initiatives--judicial-constraints">1.2 Doge Initiatives &amp; Judicial Constraints</h3>
<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Elon Musk faces significant obstacles. Congressional Republicans have balked at approving proposed budget cuts [1], while operational scrutiny intensifies after reports that a college student was put in charge of using AI to rewrite HUD regulations [2]. Musk is simultaneously developing plans for a &ldquo;company town&rdquo; in Texas [3].</p>
<p>The judiciary has checked executive authority as federal judges struck down Trump&rsquo;s order targeting law firm Perkins Coie [4] and halted attempts to dismantle Voice of America [5]. Courts have also blocked deportations conducted under wartime act provisions, prompting Trump&rsquo;s angry response that &ldquo;Our Country, as we know it, is finished!&rdquo; [6]</p>

<p>The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April 2025, stronger than economists had anticipated [1]. However, President Trump has acknowledged the possibility of a recession, characterizing the current economic situation as a &ldquo;transition period&rdquo; [2] and suggesting that a short-term economic downturn would be acceptable for long-term prosperity.</p>
<p>The administration has unveiled a budget proposal allocating $1 trillion for defense while implementing substantial cuts to education, foreign aid, environmental programs, health initiatives, and public assistance [3]. Specific cuts include a 40% reduction in rental aid, with the administration suggesting states could fill the funding gap if they choose [4].</p>

<h3 id="22-tariffs--corporate-impacts">2.2 Tariffs &amp; Corporate Impacts</h3>
<p>The administration&rsquo;s tariff policies are creating significant economic ripple effects. Warren Buffett criticized Trump&rsquo;s tariff policies, stating the U.S. shouldn&rsquo;t use &ldquo;trade as a weapon&rdquo; [1] and characterizing the approach as an &ldquo;act of war&rdquo; in economic terms [2]. A major health care company has reported that new tariffs will cost it between $60-70 million this year [3].</p>
<p>E-commerce platform Temu has halted direct shipping from China following the closure of the &ldquo;de minimis&rdquo; tariff loophole [4]. President Trump acknowledged consumer impacts, stating U.S. kids may get &ldquo;two dolls instead of 30&rdquo; due to tariffs [5]. Meanwhile, Buffett stepped down as Berkshire Hathaway CEO while warning about the trade war&rsquo;s harmful effects on America [6].</p>

<p>The Trump administration has developed comprehensive deportation initiatives, including plans to track approximately 450,000 migrant children through door knocks and DNA tests [1]. International negotiations are underway, with reports indicating talks with Rwanda to accept deportees from the United States [2], while Mexico&rsquo;s President Claudia Sheinbaum rejected Trump&rsquo;s offer to send U.S. troops to Mexico [3].</p>
<p>The deportation campaign has led to American citizens crossing state lines seeking safety, described by some as &ldquo;refugees&rdquo; [4], while raising questions about the status of U.S. citizen children whose parents face deportation [5]. The administration has implemented a strict &ldquo;catch and revoke&rdquo; policy for visa holders, establishing a zero-tolerance approach to visa compliance [6].</p>
