<p>Federal workforce reductions have resulted in personal hardships, including a case where an employee was laid off months before pension eligibility, losing $3,000 monthly in anticipated benefits [1]. The IRS anticipates a 20% workforce reduction from a new Trump resignation offer [2]. The Pentagon&rsquo;s specialized technology unit, described as a &ldquo;SWAT team of nerds,&rdquo; has resigned en masse [3]. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is dismantling Pentagon programs designed to reduce civilian casualties, with his focus on &ldquo;lethality&rdquo; prompting warnings that this approach could lead to &ldquo;wanton killing and wholesale destruction and disregard for law&rdquo; [4].</p>

<p>Multiple outlets have characterized the administration&rsquo;s approach as a constitutional crisis. The Atlantic published &ldquo;The Constitutional Crisis Is Here&rdquo; [1], while USA Today reports that &ldquo;America is dangerously close to being run by a king who answers to no one&rdquo; [2]. Media relations have deteriorated, with Trump &ldquo;ramping up his war with the press&rdquo; [3] and reportedly barring Associated Press journalists from an Oval Office event despite a court order [4]. President Trump has signed a healthcare executive order that includes provisions favorable to pharmaceutical companies [5] and halted hundreds of federal regulations [6].</p>

<p>A major controversy surrounds the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, detained in El Salvador, with Senator Van Hollen requesting a meeting with President Bukele and announcing plans to travel there if Garcia is not returned [1]. A federal judge has ordered expedited discovery [2] and will question Trump officials regarding their refusal to return Abrego Garcia [3], noting that the &ldquo;Supreme Court has spoken&rdquo; while criticizing the administration for doing &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; to facilitate his return.</p>
<p>In another high-profile case, a Palestinian student activist from Columbia University was arrested by ICE agents when he arrived for what he believed would be his citizenship interview in Vermont [4]. ICE also deported a Venezuelan teenager despite reportedly knowing he was not a target [5].</p>

<p>Immigration enforcement has intensified, with thousands of migrants who had been following legal protocols now being ordered to leave the country [1]. A federal judge blocked an attempt to strip deportation protections from approximately 500,000 immigrants, describing it as &ldquo;unlawful action&rdquo; [2], while a Colorado judge has implemented a temporary hold on deportations sought under the Alien Enemies Act [3]. The administration is reportedly pushing immigrants to self-deport as its deportation numbers lag [4] and has moved to expedite asylum cases without court hearings [5].</p>
