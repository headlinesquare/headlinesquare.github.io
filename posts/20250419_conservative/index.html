<p>The Supreme Court has ordered a temporary halt to deportations under the 18th century Alien Enemies Act, specifically blocking the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants [1][2]. This follows Federal Judge James Boasberg&rsquo;s earlier denial of an emergency request to block &ldquo;imminent&rdquo; deportation flights under the same act [3]. SCOTUS specifically blocked deportation of alleged Tren De Aragua gang members [4]. In a parallel development, a Biden-appointed judge blocked Trump&rsquo;s plan for rapid third-country deportations [5].</p>

<p>Vice President JD Vance discussed migration during a Vatican meeting, described as an &ldquo;exchange of opinions&rdquo; with top officials [1][2]. California legislators have introduced a bill that would prioritize illegal immigrants for disaster aid [3]. The deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia has become particularly contentious, with Senator Chris Van Hollen denying that he or other Democratic lawmakers drank margaritas with Garcia during their El Salvador visit [4]. Oversight Chair James Comer criticized Democratic representatives for seeking taxpayer-funded trips to visit the deportee [5]. Stephen Miller characterized Democrats&rsquo; immigration stance as viewing Americans as &ldquo;acceptable collateral damage&rdquo; in what he called a &ldquo;war against citizenship&rdquo; [6].</p>

<p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, described as an alleged MS-13 gangbanger, is reportedly no longer being held in El Salvador&rsquo;s notorious CECOT megaprison according to Senator Chris Van Hollen [1]. Debate over Garcia&rsquo;s tattoos has fueled what some sources call &ldquo;conspiracy theories&rdquo; [2]. In Florida, five individuals described as &ldquo;illegal aliens&rdquo; and believed to be members of Venezuela&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tren de Aragua&rdquo; gang have been arrested for liquor thefts and robberies [3]. An MS-13 member and Honduran national was sentenced to 147 months in federal prison for kidnapping a former federal witness at gunpoint in Nashville [4]. In New Mexico, a Democratic judge abruptly resigned following the arrest of a suspected Tren de Aragua gang member for firearm possession at the judge&rsquo;s residence [5].</p>

<p>The White House has indicated that President Trump is studying whether he has the authority to dismiss the Federal Reserve chief [1], a move with potential implications for central bank independence. Trump has directed bureaucrats to &ldquo;follow the law&rdquo; [2], though specifics of this directive remain unclear. A legal analysis claims &ldquo;the President has not defied a Supreme Court ruling&rdquo; [3], though the specific ruling is not identified. Trump has also signed an executive order aimed at boosting the U.S. seafood industry [4].</p>
