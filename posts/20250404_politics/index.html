<p>Financial markets have reacted sharply, with a historic two-day drop wiping out $6 trillion in value[1]. JPMorgan has raised its recession probability estimate to 60%[2] and predicts Trump&rsquo;s tariffs could push the US into recession by 2025[3]. Federal Reserve Chairman Powell warned that tariffs could lead to persistent high inflation[4]. President Trump has publicly pressured Powell to cut interest rates, accusing him of &ldquo;playing politics&rdquo;[5].</p>

Major business leaders are reportedly &ldquo;puzzled&rdquo; and &ldquo;struggling to navigate Trump&rsquo;s new world&rdquo;[4]. Senator Cruz has warned that Trump&rsquo;s trade policies risk a &ldquo;political bloodbath&rdquo; if they fail[5] and could lead to a &ldquo;GOP wipeout in 2026 elections&rdquo;[6].</p>

<p>The administration is advancing policy through executive orders rather than legislation[1], with President Trump &ldquo;sidelining the Justice Dept.

Significant personnel changes include the removal of General Timothy Haugh, head of the National Security Agency and Cyber Command[3], and Senate confirmation of Dr. Mehmet Oz to lead Medicare and Medicaid[4]. Multiple National Security Council staff members were reportedly dismissed following meetings between President Trump and far-right activist Laura Loomer[5].</p>
