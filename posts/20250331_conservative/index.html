<h3 id="12-executive-orders-and-policy-implementation">1.2 Executive Orders and Policy Implementation</h3>
<p>The administration has begun implementing significant policy changes through executive action. Tulsi Gabbard has revoked security clearances and access to classified information from multiple high-profile officials including President Biden, Vice President Harris, and former Secretary Clinton [1]. In the military sphere, Hegseth has ordered a return to &ldquo;sex-neutral standards&rdquo; [2]. Meanwhile, FTC Commissioner Melissa Holyoak is reportedly working remotely from Utah despite Trump&rsquo;s return-to-office order and DOGE clampdown [3]. Questions have also emerged regarding the status of the General Accounting Office [4].</p>

<p>Elon Musk, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has announced a new investigative focus on members of Congress who have accumulated significant wealth while in office [1]. Musk has specifically questioned how certain members of Congress have obtained substantial wealth, reportedly asking &ldquo;How&rsquo;d They Get $20 Million?&rdquo; [2]. This initiative appears to be part of DOGE&rsquo;s broader efforts to identify potential financial impropriety in government.</p>

<h3 id="14-presidential-communications-and-activities">1.4 Presidential Communications and Activities</h3>
<p>President Trump has made several significant public communications, expressing strong criticism of Russian President Putin regarding Ukraine in an NBC interview described as using &ldquo;salty&rdquo; and &ldquo;no uncertain terms&rdquo; [1]. In another statement, Trump claimed Ukrainian President Zelenskyy wants to withdraw from a previously agreed mineral deal, while also addressing questions about a potential third term [2]. Despite recent controversies including &ldquo;Signal-Gate,&rdquo; a CBS poll indicates Trump has maintained a 50 percent approval rating [3]. The White House has also announced plans to take control of the briefing room seating arrangements [4].</p>
