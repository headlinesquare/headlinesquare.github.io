<p>President Trump is reportedly considering suspending habeas corpus, a fundamental legal protection preventing indefinite detention without trial [1]. Time magazine has published an analysis of how this constitutional protection is &ldquo;under threat&rdquo; [2], while Senator Barrasso stated he doesn&rsquo;t believe a suggested suspension will &ldquo;come to Congress&rdquo; [3]. The Supreme Court is currently hearing arguments on birthright citizenship in a case that tests the Court&rsquo;s willingness to constrain executive actions [4].</p>

<p>Multiple news outlets report that the Trump administration plans to accept a luxury jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One [1][2], though Qatar has called these reports &ldquo;inaccurate&rdquo; [3]. A House Committee has launched an investigation into allegations that a politically connected startup received preferential treatment from a federal agency [4]. President Trump has also fired the director of the U.S. Copyright Office shortly after a report questioned whether AI training constitutes fair use [5].</p>

<p>Despite cuts implemented by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), federal spending has increased by $166 billion compared to the previous year [1]. A U.S. judge has temporarily halted Trump&rsquo;s drastic cuts to federal agencies [2]. DOGE and HHS Secretary RFK Jr. have gutted legally required offices within federal agencies [3], actions that now face potential judicial reversal. Elon Musk, who heads DOGE, appears to be benefiting as his &ldquo;regulatory troubles have begun to melt away&rdquo; [4].</p>

<p>Recent Geneva talks between the US and China resulted in what President Trump characterized as a &ldquo;total reset&rdquo; in bilateral relations [1], with officials reaching an agreement to reduce the trade deficit [2]. The negotiations focused primarily on tariff discussions as the administration attempts to reframe relations between the world&rsquo;s two largest economies, with officials reportedly achieving &ldquo;substantial progress&rdquo; [3].</p>

<h3 id="22-middle-east-policy">2.2 Middle East Policy</h3>
<p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Middle Eastern Gulf allies with a focus on trade and investment opportunities [1], while pursuing a $1 trillion investment and attempting to broker Saudi ties to Israel [2]. The trip to Saudi Arabia raises the prospect of U.S. nuclear cooperation with the kingdom [3], signaling a potential major shift in nuclear proliferation policy. Tensions between Trump and Netanyahu have emerged over disagreements on Iran and Gaza [4], while critics suggest Gulf states may be dictating U.S. foreign policy rather than Trump shaping the region [5].</p>

<p>After three years of war, Russian President Putin has proposed direct peace talks with Ukraine [1], with President Trump demanding Ukraine hold direct talks with Russia [2]. In response, Ukrainian President Zelensky has offered to meet with President Putin [3]. Senator Marco Rubio plans to visit Turkey to advance renewed peace talks potentially hosted in Istanbul [4], though U.S. and European leaders have rejected Russia&rsquo;s proposal for negotiations without a ceasefire first [5].</p>
