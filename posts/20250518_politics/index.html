<p>Qatar&rsquo;s gift of a jet to President Trump has drawn scrutiny, with CNN noting past presidents couldn&rsquo;t keep similar gifts [1] and former Vice President Mike Pence calling it a &ldquo;bad idea&rdquo; with &ldquo;profound issues&rdquo; [2]. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the acceptance by comparing it to France&rsquo;s gift of the Statue of Liberty [3]. AP News reports Trump could leave fewer official records than any previous U.S. president [4].</p>

<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) faces criticism, with its activities characterized as &ldquo;reckless destruction&rdquo; motivated by &ldquo;a determination to crush workers&rdquo; [1]. The USDA was forced through litigation to restore previously removed climate data web pages after farmers sued [2]. Secretary of State Marco Rubio directly contradicted intelligence community assessments, explicitly stating analysts are &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; regarding their assessment of Tren de Aragua [3].</p>

<p>President Trump&rsquo;s administration is heading toward a constitutional confrontation with the judiciary over separation of powers [1]. The flashpoint centers on the Supreme Court&rsquo;s ruling blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, which Trump has endorsed the idea is &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; [2]. The president described the ruling as a &ldquo;Bad and dangerous day for America!&rdquo; marking an extraordinary challenge to judicial authority [3].</p>

<p>The Trump Justice Department is considering removing a key check on lawmaker prosecutions, potentially altering the relationship between the executive branch and Congress [1]. The department has reached a deal ending a ban on an aftermarket trigger for firearms, a decision that gun control advocates characterize as alarming [2]. Rolling Stone reports the DOJ is considering policy changes that would lower barriers to indicting members of Congress [3].</p>

<p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has implemented a significant shift in enforcement strategy by adopting a new tactic of deporting people facing criminal charges before their court appearances [1]. This approach represents a departure from previous practices where individuals typically remained in the country through completion of criminal proceedings. ICE officials have confirmed that arrests will continue in Washington, DC [2].</p>
