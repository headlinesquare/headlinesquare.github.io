<h2 id="1-the-trump-administration">1. The Trump Administration</h2>
<h3 id="11-significant-personnel-actions-across-federal-departments">1.1. Significant Personnel Actions Across Federal Departments</h3>
<p>The administration has initiated a series of high-profile personnel changes across key federal departments. At the Department of Defense, Secretary Pete Hegseth concluded the week by dismissing three senior generals, signaling a significant leadership shift [1]. This move is paralleled by a major staff reduction at the Department of Health and Human Services, which has permanently fired 600 employees from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [2]. The actions extend to regulatory agencies, with a report indicating that an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) lawyer, who was the subject of a story on &ldquo;Far-Left Advocacy,&rdquo; has been placed on administrative leave [3]. These actions collectively point to a deliberate and assertive effort to reshape the workforce in critical national security, public health, and financial oversight agencies.</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>The Trump administration has initiated a significant domestic security and immigration operation, authorizing the mobilization of up to 1,700 National Guard members across 19 states for a widened &ldquo;crime crackdown&rdquo; [1, 2]. As a central component of this initiative, the administration has authorized on-duty National Guard troops in Washington D.C. to carry firearms [3]. The D.C. deployment, costing a reported $1 million a day, is already facing scrutiny, with reports indicating troops are being positioned in some of the city&rsquo;s &ldquo;safest sites&rdquo; [4, 5].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<h3 id="11-investigation-of-former-national-security-advisor-john-bolton">1.1. Investigation of Former National Security Advisor John Bolton</h3>
<p>Federal law enforcement has executed high-profile raids on the home and office of John Bolton, who served as National Security Advisor in the Trump administration [1]. The operation, conducted by FBI Director Kash Patel’s agency, is reportedly part of an investigation into allegations that Bolton sent classified documents to family members [1]. This development appears to be linked to a previous federal probe that was initiated following the publication of Bolton’s highly controversial 2020 memoir [2]. Media commentary following the raid suggests an anticipation of further action, with one Fox News contributor predicting &ldquo;a lot of big stuff coming&rdquo; [3]. The incident has also prompted sharp political reactions, with commentators using Bolton&rsquo;s own past statements to criticize him in light of the federal investigation [4].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies were at the center of a series of high-stakes actions targeting current and former officials. The FBI conducted searches of the Maryland home and office of John Bolton, former National Security Advisor and a prominent critic of President Trump, as part of a &ldquo;resumed national security investigation&rdquo; [1]. According to reports, the search occurred just hours after Bolton had publicly criticized the President on CNN [2]. In response, President Trump called his former aide a &ldquo;lowlife&rdquo; and &ldquo;a very unpatriotic guy,&rdquo; while Vice President JD Vance later stated that the investigation was not a result of Bolton&rsquo;s political criticism [3, 4].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<h3 id="11-high-profile-national-security-probe-targets-john-bolton">1.1 High-Profile National Security Probe Targets John Bolton</h3>
<p>A major national security investigation is underway involving former National Security Advisor John Bolton. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed his agency conducted a raid on Bolton&rsquo;s Maryland residence, an action described as part of a high-profile probe into the handling of classified documents [1, 2]. The development has brought the widely reported &ldquo;longstanding Trump-Bolton feud&rdquo; back into the headlines, providing a political backdrop to the federal action [3]. In a notable show of support for the executive branch&rsquo;s move, top Republicans in the House have publicly praised FBI Director Patel&rsquo;s leadership in executing the raid [4].</p></div><div class="post-footer">
