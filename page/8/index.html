<p>Approximately 100 days into his second term, President Trump faces declining approval ratings below those of Biden, Obama, and Bush at comparable periods [1]. CNN documented 53 instances where Trump claimed he would end the Ukraine war within 24 hours, contradicting his recent claim these statements were &ldquo;in jest&rdquo; [2]. The president expressed reservations about whether America should be ruled &ldquo;100 percent&rdquo; by laws rather than men [3] and criticized Fox News for reporting his declining economic approval ratings [4].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order eliminating disparate-impact theory, which advocates describe as restoring the 1964 Civil Rights Act to its original meaning and promoting meritocracy [1] [2]. This represents one of the administration&rsquo;s most significant policy shifts, fundamentally changing federal civil rights enforcement.</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>Federal agencies face significant staff reductions as FEMA loses approximately 20% of its permanent staff, including longtime leaders, just ahead of hurricane season [1]. The Department of Transportation initially invited resignations but now scrambles to retain essential personnel [2]. The FDA is suspending its quality-control program for food testing due to staff cuts [3], while scientific communities race to preserve decades of data from potential deletion [4]. The Department of Justice has undergone dramatic reorganization with Trump &ldquo;upending&rdquo; the Civil Rights Division, causing what has been characterized as a &ldquo;bloodbath&rdquo; in senior ranks [5].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>President Trump has signed several significant executive orders in April 2025, including a &ldquo;landmark order to restore equality of opportunity and meritocracy&rdquo; [1]. The administration is targeting ActBlue, described as &ldquo;notorious for its lax standards,&rdquo; with investigations into alleged illegal campaign donations [2] [3]. Trump has also issued orders &ldquo;taking a sledgehammer to DEI&rdquo; in education [4] and asked the Supreme Court to uphold his military personnel ban [5].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>President Trump continues reshaping federal operations through executive orders. A little-known federal agency is central to his executive order overhauling U.S. elections [1]. Nearly all federal workers investigating firefighter deaths have been laid off [2]. A judge criticized Trump&rsquo;s anti-collective bargaining order as specifically &ldquo;targeting&rdquo; unions that challenged him [3].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>Elon Musk will &ldquo;significantly&rdquo; reduce his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) starting next month [1].
