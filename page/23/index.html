Senator Warren has formally requested contingency plans in response to their increasingly hostile social media exchanges [1].

<p>The relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk has deteriorated into an open conflict with significant governance implications. Trump has explicitly stated he has &ldquo;no plans to speak to Musk&rdquo; as their feud persists [1]. The confrontation includes serious personal attacks – Musk sharing footage of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein [2] while Trump suggests Musk has a &ldquo;drug habit&rdquo; [3]. Reports indicate Musk has deleted some of his most explosive posts amid the escalating feud [4], including one claiming Trump was &ldquo;in the Epstein files&rdquo; [5]. A physical altercation reportedly occurred at the White House where Musk &ldquo;hit rival &rsquo;like a rugby player&rsquo;&rdquo; in an incident that had to be broken up by bystanders [6].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<h3 id="11-trumpmusk-relations-and-doge-operations">1.1 Trump‑Musk Relations and DOGE Operations</h3>
<p>The relationship between President Trump and former DOGE head Elon Musk has collapsed, with Trump explicitly declaring &ldquo;his relationship with Elon Musk is over&rdquo; [1]. The conflict escalated after Musk made a post linking Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, which he subsequently deleted [2]. This controversy was characterized as a &ldquo;dust-up&rdquo; in an interview with Vice President JD Vance [3], with reports indicating the &ldquo;feud continues to intensify&rdquo; [4]. Musk attempted to walk back his comments, offering to &ldquo;apologize &lsquo;profusely&rsquo;&rdquo; upon the release of the Epstein files [5]. The dispute has had financial ramifications, with Tesla reportedly losing $34 billion in share value, prompting Musk to &ldquo;back down&rdquo; [6]. This public falling out raises questions about the future of DOGE&rsquo;s operations following Musk&rsquo;s departure.</p></div><div class="post-footer">
