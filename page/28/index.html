<p>The Trump administration is implementing substantial changes across multiple agencies. The National Security Council (NSC) is undergoing major restructuring with over 100 staffers placed on administrative leave [1] and officials confirming &ldquo;drastic cuts&rdquo; [2] in what&rsquo;s described as a &ldquo;major foreign policy shakeup&rdquo; [3].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<h3 id="11-trump-administration-actions--policies">1.1 Trump Administration Actions &amp; Policies</h3>
<p>The Trump administration has secured several policy and legal victories this month. A judge has ruled that Trump acted lawfully regarding Chinese tariffs, representing a court win for the White House [1]. The administration announced a major job-creating deal that was reportedly blocked by Biden during his final days in office [2]. In a significant address to the United States Military Academy&rsquo;s graduating class of 2025 [3], President Trump stated that &ldquo;The job of the US Armed Forces is not to host drag shows, to change foreign cultures, or to spread democracy &hellip; at the point of a gun&rdquo; [4]. The White House has highlighted economic improvements, announcing the &ldquo;lowest Memorial Day weekend prices since 2021,&rdquo; attributed to what one source calls &ldquo;The Trump Effect&rdquo; [5].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>The Supreme Court has dramatically expanded presidential authority by granting President Trump&rsquo;s request to fire independent agency members, while explicitly exempting the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell [1]. Justice Kagan issued a dissent condemning the elevation of &ldquo;President over our precedent&rdquo; [2]. This ruling is described by critics as &ldquo;killing the independent agency&rdquo; [3]. Chief Justice Roberts has separately stayed a lower court order that would have required DOGE to surrender documents to a watchdog organization [4].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>President Trump has signed an executive order reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, aimed at reducing U.S. dependence on foreign nuclear technologies and decreasing regulatory barriers in the sector [1]. The administration has also directed the USDA to terminate &ldquo;maximum pain bird flu gain-of-function experiments&rdquo; that were being conducted with the parent organization of the Wuhan lab [2]. The Senate has voted to overturn California&rsquo;s electric vehicle mandate, described as a &ldquo;resounding defeat for climate activists&rdquo; [3].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed President Trump&rsquo;s sweeping domestic policy package, officially titled the &ldquo;One Big Beautiful Bill Act&rdquo; (H.R.1) [1], after an overnight marathon session [2]. The legislation passed by a single vote [3], with Republicans securing key holdout votes including Rep. Chip Roy [4]. The vote was notably dramatic – at least one Republican representative missed the crucial vote because he fell asleep [5]. The bill now advances to the Senate where GOP leadership is working to avoid a potential revolt [6], particularly regarding the Medicaid provisions.</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<h3 id="11-administration-initiatives">1.1 Administration Initiatives</h3>
<p>The Trump administration has revoked Harvard University&rsquo;s authorization to enroll international students [1][2], citing antisemitism and campus protests as justification. The Department of Homeland Security implemented this significant policy shift, potentially affecting thousands of students. In another major policy reversal, the administration has redirected $365 million previously allocated for Puerto Rico solar power projects [3], demonstrating a shift in energy priorities. Attorney General Bondi&rsquo;s Justice Department has dismissed lawsuits against police departments initiated by the previous administration [4], signaling a change in federal oversight of law enforcement. Vice President Vance has publicly defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act while criticizing judicial intervention in immigration enforcement [5]. A troubling report claims U.S. officials during the previous administration deliberately delayed warning the public about heart inflammation risks associated with COVID-19 vaccines [6].</p></div><div class="post-footer">
