<p>President Trump has issued a series of executive orders expanding presidential authority, including orders punishing individuals who opposed his 2020 election claims [1] and probing former cybersecurity officials who defied him [2]. The White House is seeking legally binding control over Columbia University through a consent decree [3] while issuing an order on &ldquo;Restoring truth and sanity to American History&rdquo; [4].

The administration claims $7 trillion in investment flowing to the US [4], and reports suggest Trump has &ldquo;outmaneuvered markets, allies, and China&rdquo; [5].

<p>International responses have been swift. China announced 84% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods [4], causing oil prices to tumble more than 6% [5]. The European Union approved €20 billion in retaliatory tariffs targeting Republican-leaning states [6], while Japan and Canada agreed to cooperate on market stability measures [7].</p></div><div class="post-footer">
