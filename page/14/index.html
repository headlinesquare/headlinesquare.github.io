<p>President Trump marked his first 100 days with rallies and interviews amid declining polling numbers [1][2]. At a Michigan rally, Trump declared his administration &ldquo;the most successful first 100 days of any administration&rdquo; [3], attacked &ldquo;communist&rdquo; judges, and warned that &ldquo;nothing will stop me&rdquo; [4]. Multiple polls show Trump with the &ldquo;worst 100-day polling ever&rdquo; [5] and indicate voters are &ldquo;souring&rdquo; on his performance, particularly in Georgia where economic fears are rising [2]. PBS analysis indicates Trump has reshaped federal operations in three major areas [6], while Democrats formally rallied at the Capitol to condemn what they characterize as a failed start [7].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>President Trump marked his first 100 days with a Michigan rally where he defended tariff policies and Musk-led government reorganization [1], claiming his administration achieved the &ldquo;most successful&rdquo; first 100 days in presidential history [2]. Public opinion appears mixed, with some Americans rating this period &ldquo;excellent&rdquo; while others believe changes are happening &ldquo;too fast&rdquo; [3]. The White House released a document listing &ldquo;dozens of hoaxes&rdquo; pushed by media during this period [4]. Media interactions have been contentious, with Trump bluntly telling ABC reporter Terry Moran &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust you&rdquo; during a &ldquo;fiery&rdquo; interview [5]. Vice President Vance described Trump&rsquo;s leadership as &ldquo;empowering&rdquo; and fostering &ldquo;trust&rdquo; while reducing internal &ldquo;turf battles&rdquo; [6].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>President Trump&rsquo;s first 100 days have generated predominantly negative polling data. Only 39% approve of his economic handling [1], while most Americans view him as &ldquo;a dangerous dictator&rdquo; [2]. His popularity has hit &ldquo;historic lows&rdquo; [3], with a significant plurality assigning him an &ldquo;F&rdquo; grade—more than any other grade [4]. Financial markets are experiencing their worst 100-day start since Nixon due to &ldquo;semi-permanent uncertainty&rdquo; [5].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>President Trump&rsquo;s administration continues implementing significant policy changes through executive action. The administration has mandated English proficiency and literacy tests for truck drivers, citing communication challenges [1], and issued an executive order supporting local police while criticizing Democratic policies that allegedly created &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; [2]. The Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Office has been substantially reconfigured, reportedly causing significant staff departures described as an &ldquo;exodus&rdquo; [3]. The administration reports fulfilling inauguration pledges in its first 100 days [4], focused on eliminating what it terms &ldquo;reverse discrimination&rdquo; [5].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>President Trump has made expansive claims about his authority, stating in an Atlantic interview, &ldquo;I run the country and the world&rdquo; [1] [2]. This assertion comes amid declining poll numbers showing his approval rating slipping to 41% after nearly 100 days [3], prompting him to &ldquo;lash out against &lsquo;fake polls&rsquo;&rdquo; [4] and reportedly demand investigations into unfavorable polling data [5]. During Vatican talks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, Trump described him as &ldquo;calmer&rdquo; [6] and later suggested he believes Zelenskyy may be willing to cede Crimea to Russia [7]. Presidential directives now include plans to sign executive orders mandating truckers speak English [8] and requiring creation of a &ldquo;nationwide list of sanctuary cities and states&rdquo; [9].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

The White House has highlighted a &ldquo;100-day illegal immigration crackdown&rdquo; [1], contrasting it with claims the previous administration &ldquo;unsecured the border on purpose.&rdquo; President Trump is preparing to sign executive orders targeting sanctuary cities alleged to violate federal immigration laws [2] and requiring commercial truck drivers demonstrate English language proficiency [3].</p></div><div class="post-footer">
