<p>Multiple reports document U.S. citizens, primarily children, being deported in recent immigration operations. A federal judge highlighted a case where a 2-year-old U.S. citizen &ldquo;appears to have been deported with no meaningful process&rdquo; [1][2]. The child was &ldquo;apparently deported to Honduras&rdquo; [3]. The ACLU reports three U.S. citizen children were &ldquo;held incommunicado&rdquo; prior to deportation [4]. Additional cases include U.S. citizen children with cancer [5] and a Tampa woman separated from her one-year-old child and U.S. citizen husband after being deported to Cuba [6].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is developing a centralized database integrating information from the IRS, Social Security Administration, and Department of Health and Human Services. This database is specifically designed to enhance immigration enforcement capabilities [1].

<p>Approximately 100 days into his second term, President Trump faces declining approval ratings below those of Biden, Obama, and Bush at comparable periods [1]. CNN documented 53 instances where Trump claimed he would end the Ukraine war within 24 hours, contradicting his recent claim these statements were &ldquo;in jest&rdquo; [2]. The president expressed reservations about whether America should be ruled &ldquo;100 percent&rdquo; by laws rather than men [3] and criticized Fox News for reporting his declining economic approval ratings [4].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<h3 id="11-executive-actions">1.1 Executive Actions</h3>
<p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order eliminating disparate-impact theory, which advocates describe as restoring the 1964 Civil Rights Act to its original meaning and promoting meritocracy [1] [2]. This represents one of the administration&rsquo;s most significant policy shifts, fundamentally changing federal civil rights enforcement.</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>Federal agencies face significant staff reductions as FEMA loses approximately 20% of its permanent staff, including longtime leaders, just ahead of hurricane season [1]. The Department of Transportation initially invited resignations but now scrambles to retain essential personnel [2]. The FDA is suspending its quality-control program for food testing due to staff cuts [3], while scientific communities race to preserve decades of data from potential deletion [4]. The Department of Justice has undergone dramatic reorganization with Trump &ldquo;upending&rdquo; the Civil Rights Division, causing what has been characterized as a &ldquo;bloodbath&rdquo; in senior ranks [5].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>President Trump has signed several significant executive orders in April 2025, including a &ldquo;landmark order to restore equality of opportunity and meritocracy&rdquo; [1]. The administration is targeting ActBlue, described as &ldquo;notorious for its lax standards,&rdquo; with investigations into alleged illegal campaign donations [2] [3]. Trump has also issued orders &ldquo;taking a sledgehammer to DEI&rdquo; in education [4] and asked the Supreme Court to uphold his military personnel ban [5].</p></div><div class="post-footer">
