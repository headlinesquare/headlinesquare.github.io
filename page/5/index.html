U.S. officials have confirmed the movement of B-2 stealth bombers to Guam, a key strategic deployment amid the heightened tensions. The crisis is escalating with reports of fresh attacks by both Israel and Iran, prompting Tehran to declare it &ldquo;will not negotiate [its] nuclear programme while under threat&rdquo; [2]. The international dimension is volatile, as sources indicate Israel is advocating for swift action while Russia has issued a warning that the world is &ldquo;millimeters away from a nuclear catastrophe&rdquo; [3].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>DAILY BRIEFING</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The nation is grappling with a series of escalating crises that are straining its political and institutional foundations. A severe public schism has erupted between the White House and the intelligence community over Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program, compounded by reports that the administration has considered using tactical nuclear weapons. This foreign policy emergency unfolds as the Republican majority’s central legislative ambition, a sweeping &ldquo;megabill,&rdquo; teeters on the brink of collapse due to a damaging ruling from the Senate Parliamentarian and significant internal party fractures. Concurrently, the executive branch is aggressively expanding its authority through the domestic deployment of military forces—bolstered by a key court victory—and a rapid-fire overhaul of federal agencies. The Supreme Court continues to issue consequential rulings reshaping environmental, social, and economic policy, often creating sharp ideological divides among the justices. This is all set against a backdrop of increasing political violence, with direct threats and physical attacks on lawmakers, and profound internal turmoil corroding the leadership structures of both the Republican and Democratic parties.</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<h3 id="11-us-iran-tensions-reach-critical-point">1.1 U.S.-Iran Tensions Reach Critical Point</h3>
<p>The decision on potential U.S. military action against Iranian nuclear facilities remains stalled, with sources indicating a two-week delay stems from President Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;fear of Iran becoming ‘another Libya’&rdquo; [1]. This public hesitation has fueled a debate over the administration&rsquo;s strategy, with foreign press questioning if the President has &ldquo;chickened out&rdquo; [2] and domestic commentary suggesting that opponents of military action are attempting to &ldquo;relitigate the Iraq War&rdquo; [3]. The crisis is creating a significant conflict over constitutional war powers. While a legal expert asserts the President &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t need permission&rsquo; from Congress to strike&rdquo; [4], Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has issued a direct public warning to the President against such an attack [5]. Compounding the situation, Iran has formally rejected the President&rsquo;s nuclear terms. In an effort to control the information landscape, the President has also issued a &ldquo;Dire Warning to Reporters&rdquo; who inquire about Iran&rsquo;s specific nuclear capabilities [6].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<h3 id="11-white-house-on-the-brink-of-a-decision">1.1. White House on the Brink of a Decision</h3>
<p>The administration has publicly declared its intent to decide on U.S. military action in the Israel-Iran conflict within two weeks, placing the nation on a high-stakes countdown [1]. President Trump has personally signaled the gravity of the situation, identifying the disabling of Iran&rsquo;s Fordo nuclear facility as a necessary objective [2]. While the President now publicly denies reports that he has already approved specific US attack plans [3], this follows earlier reporting that a set of plans had been greenlit but not yet executed [4]. Most alarmingly, one report claims the White House is contemplating the use of nuclear weapons against Iran [5]. In a direct statement, the President added to the uncertainty, saying he &ldquo;may or may not&rdquo; strike Iran [6].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<h3 id="11-us-military-posture--iran-ultimatum">1.1 U.S. Military Posture &amp; Iran Ultimatum</h3>
<p>The United States is undertaking significant strategic military actions amidst rapidly escalating global tensions. The Pentagon has reportedly deployed the $13 billion USS Gerald Ford, a high-tech aircraft carrier, to the Mediterranean Sea as a clear show of force while &ldquo;World Tensions Flare&rdquo; [1]. This deployment occurs amid a volatile and confusing series of signals directed at Iran from the executive branch. A report from The Wall Street Journal alleged that President Trump had privately approved military attack plans for Iran, awaiting only a final order to proceed [2]. President Trump subsequently issued a public and direct denial of that report [3]. Following this, the President shifted tactics, publicly giving Iran a two-week deadline &ldquo;to negotiate&rdquo; or face unspecified consequences [4]. Fueling the uncertainty, media commentary points to internal pressures on the administration, with one report highlighting a &ldquo;&lsquo;jacked gorilla&rsquo; general pushing Trump to strike Iran&rdquo; [5]. Simultaneously, an opinion piece co-authored by Yoav Gallant argues that while Israel has done most of the work, &ldquo;only Trump can finish it&rdquo; [6].</p></div><div class="post-footer">
