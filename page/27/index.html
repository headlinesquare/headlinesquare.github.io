<h3 id="11-constitutional-statements-and-powers">1.1 Constitutional Statements and Powers</h3>
<p>President Trump has raised significant constitutional concerns through recent statements. When directly asked if he is required to uphold the Constitution, Trump responded, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; [1]. This statement has been consistently reported across ideological lines. Similarly, Trump told Reuters he is &ldquo;unsure whether people in the US are entitled to due process&rdquo; [2]. The New York Times reports that intellectual foundations are &ldquo;setting the stage for Trump the All-Powerful&rdquo; [3], while analysts suggest his next 100 days will make his already consequential first 100 days &ldquo;look tranquil&rdquo; [4].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>The Trump administration is implementing bureaucratic reforms, with the OMB director confirming efforts to defund what they characterize as &ldquo;woke and weaponized&rdquo; bureaucracy from the Biden era. The Department of Government Efficiency under Elon Musk is showing early impact, with recent jobs reports cited as evidence of positive results. Musk has affirmed his commitment to DOGE and support for President Trump, stating both are &ldquo;essential&rdquo; for America to &ldquo;reach greater heights&rdquo;. When questioned about potential regrets, Musk responded definitively that he has none, adding &ldquo;at least I didn&rsquo;t get shot&rdquo;.</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<h3 id="11-presidential-executive-orders--directives">1.1 Presidential Executive Orders &amp; Directives</h3>
<p>President Trump has issued several significant executive orders, including terminating federal funding for NPR and PBS, entities he accused of spreading &ldquo;radical, woke propaganda disguised as news&rdquo; [1] [2]. PBS and NPR leadership have characterized this order as &ldquo;unlawful,&rdquo; asserting the president lacks authority to defund these organizations [3]. Trump has also stated he will revoke Harvard University&rsquo;s tax-exempt status [4] and has proposed renaming Veterans Day to &ldquo;Victory Day for World War I&rdquo; [5]. The administration is implementing changes through the energy department to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico [6]. Resistance to these orders has emerged, as evidenced by leaked audio from an Illinois medical school administrator outlining plans to defy Trump&rsquo;s executive orders, characterizing them as an &ldquo;attack on women&rdquo; and &ldquo;attack on human rights&rdquo; [7].</p></div><div class="post-footer">
