<p>President Trump has issued several significant executive orders, including terminating federal funding for NPR and PBS, entities he accused of spreading &ldquo;radical, woke propaganda disguised as news&rdquo; [1] [2]. PBS and NPR leadership have characterized this order as &ldquo;unlawful,&rdquo; asserting the president lacks authority to defund these organizations [3]. Trump has also stated he will revoke Harvard University&rsquo;s tax-exempt status [4] and has proposed renaming Veterans Day to &ldquo;Victory Day for World War I&rdquo; [5]. The administration is implementing changes through the energy department to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico [6]. Resistance to these orders has emerged, as evidenced by leaked audio from an Illinois medical school administrator outlining plans to defy Trump&rsquo;s executive orders, characterizing them as an &ldquo;attack on women&rdquo; and &ldquo;attack on human rights&rdquo; [7].</p></div><div class="post-footer">
