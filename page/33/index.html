<h3 id="11-bill-passage-and-congressional-process">1.1 Bill Passage and Congressional Process</h3>
<p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed President Trump&rsquo;s sweeping domestic policy package, officially titled the &ldquo;One Big Beautiful Bill Act&rdquo; (H.R.1) [1], after an overnight marathon session [2]. The legislation passed by a single vote [3], with Republicans securing key holdout votes including Rep. Chip Roy [4]. The vote was notably dramatic – at least one Republican representative missed the crucial vote because he fell asleep [5]. The bill now advances to the Senate where GOP leadership is working to avoid a potential revolt [6], particularly regarding the Medicaid provisions.</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<h3 id="11-administration-initiatives">1.1 Administration Initiatives</h3>
<p>The Trump administration has revoked Harvard University&rsquo;s authorization to enroll international students [1][2], citing antisemitism and campus protests as justification. The Department of Homeland Security implemented this significant policy shift, potentially affecting thousands of students. In another major policy reversal, the administration has redirected $365 million previously allocated for Puerto Rico solar power projects [3], demonstrating a shift in energy priorities. Attorney General Bondi&rsquo;s Justice Department has dismissed lawsuits against police departments initiated by the previous administration [4], signaling a change in federal oversight of law enforcement. Vice President Vance has publicly defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act while criticizing judicial intervention in immigration enforcement [5]. A troubling report claims U.S. officials during the previous administration deliberately delayed warning the public about heart inflammation risks associated with COVID-19 vaccines [6].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>The Trump administration faces serious legal repercussions over deportations to South Sudan. A judge has ruled the administration &ldquo;violated court order(s)&rdquo; [1] [2] and officials potentially face &ldquo;criminal contempt&rdquo; charges [3]. Reports indicate Vietnamese and Burmese migrants were &ldquo;illegally deported&rdquo; to South Sudan [4], with a judge mandating U.S. officials &ldquo;keep custody of migrants flown to South Sudan&rdquo; [5].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

The administration has appointed a Space Force general to lead this major security initiative [2], and Trump has recently disclosed additional details about the system designed to protect the United States [3].

<p>President Trump has adopted a confrontational approach toward House Republicans opposing his budget bill, explicitly warning them: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t f&mdash; around with Medicaid&rdquo; [1][2]. His communication style has intensified, with hostile comments reported at a Kennedy Center Dinner [3] and unsubstantiated claims that former President Biden delayed sharing his cancer diagnosis [4]. During a press briefing, Trump claimed Biden has &ldquo;Stage 9&rdquo; cancer [5]. Following a two-hour conversation with Russian President Putin, Trump failed to secure a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire [6] and subsequently characterized the Ukraine conflict as &ldquo;not my problem&rdquo; [7].</p></div><div class="post-footer">
