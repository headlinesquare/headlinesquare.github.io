In another high-profile nomination, Dr. Casey Means, described as a &ldquo;holistic influencer&rdquo; with ties to RFK Jr., has been tapped for U.S. Surgeon General [2], with Trump later admitting he didn&rsquo;t personally know Means but accepted RFK Jr.&rsquo;s recommendation [3]. Voice of America will now receive feeds from pro-Trump network One America News [4], representing a major shift in government media operations. The administration has also announced an air traffic control system overhaul [5] and discontinued a long-standing database tracking disaster costs since 1980 [6].</p></div><div class="post-footer">

<p>The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk, has initiated plans to consolidate federal data, raising privacy concerns about Americans&rsquo; personal information [1]. DOGE&rsquo;s impact is substantial, with the IRS losing approximately one-third of its tax auditors within just two months [2].

<p>India has launched military strikes against Pakistan, described in reports as both &ldquo;missiles&rdquo; [1] and &ldquo;airstrikes&rdquo; [2]. These strikes were triggered by a terror attack, with Pakistan formally characterizing India&rsquo;s actions as an &ldquo;act of war&rdquo; while claiming to have shot down Indian fighter jets [3].
