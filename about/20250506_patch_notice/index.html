  <meta property="og:description" content="Semicolons were often added to the end of URLs, especially in r/Conservative summaries, and they became a part of the hyperlinks wrongly, making some of the hyperlinks unusable.
I often randomly test the hyperlinks and they all worked, but I just realized that I only test the longest hyperlinks, because I thought they were the ones more prone to hallucinations. I didn’t find any hallucinations.
But yesterday I clicked some of the simpler links of r/Conservative summaries and I got 30% of them not working. I panicked because I thought the hallucination caught me off guard, but then I realized all the links were real, but they each got an additional “;” attached to them, which was redundant.">

<p>I often randomly test the hyperlinks and they all worked, but I just realized that I only test the longest hyperlinks, because I thought they were the ones more prone to hallucinations. I didn&rsquo;t find any hallucinations.</p>
<p>But yesterday I clicked some of the simpler links of r/Conservative summaries and I got 30% of them not working. I panicked because I thought the hallucination caught me off guard, but then I realized all the links were real, but they each got an additional &ldquo;;&rdquo; attached to them, which was redundant.</p>
<p>The links themselves were correct but the semicolons I used to declare the end of line was wrongly identified as part of the URLs. The fix was simple. I removed all redundant semicolons from all my current and previous output documents.</p>
<p>I am really surprised of this bug because it affected so many links but it evaded my &ldquo;random&rdquo; sampling for so long, because I didn&rsquo;t test the rendered URL links very thoroughly, and I thought very long and complex links were at higher risks of hallucination, so I tested those a lot. Weird enough, those never had problems, but the shorter, simpler links did. I am very sorry for the potential confusion it might have created.</p>
