<h3 id="11-performance-assessment-and-public-opinion">1.1 Performance Assessment and Public Opinion</h3>
<p>President Trump&rsquo;s first 100 days have generated predominantly negative polling data. Only 39% approve of his economic handling [1], while most Americans view him as &ldquo;a dangerous dictator&rdquo; [2]. His popularity has hit &ldquo;historic lows&rdquo; [3], with a significant plurality assigning him an &ldquo;F&rdquo; gradeâ€”more than any other grade [4]. Financial markets are experiencing their worst 100-day start since Nixon due to &ldquo;semi-permanent uncertainty&rdquo; [5].</p>]]></description>

<h3 id="11-executive-orders-and-policy-implementation">1.1 Executive Orders and Policy Implementation</h3>
<p>President Trump&rsquo;s administration continues implementing significant policy changes through executive action. The administration has mandated English proficiency and literacy tests for truck drivers, citing communication challenges [1], and issued an executive order supporting local police while criticizing Democratic policies that allegedly created &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; [2]. The Justice Department&rsquo;s Civil Rights Office has been substantially reconfigured, reportedly causing significant staff departures described as an &ldquo;exodus&rdquo; [3]. The administration reports fulfilling inauguration pledges in its first 100 days [4], focused on eliminating what it terms &ldquo;reverse discrimination&rdquo; [5].</p>]]></description>

<h3 id="11-presidential-authority-and-rhetoric">1.1 Presidential Authority and Rhetoric</h3>
<p>President Trump has made expansive claims about his authority, stating in an Atlantic interview, &ldquo;I run the country and the world&rdquo; [1] [2]. This assertion comes amid declining poll numbers showing his approval rating slipping to 41% after nearly 100 days [3], prompting him to &ldquo;lash out against &lsquo;fake polls&rsquo;&rdquo; [4] and reportedly demand investigations into unfavorable polling data [5]. During Vatican talks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, Trump described him as &ldquo;calmer&rdquo; [6] and later suggested he believes Zelenskyy may be willing to cede Crimea to Russia [7]. Presidential directives now include plans to sign executive orders mandating truckers speak English [8] and requiring creation of a &ldquo;nationwide list of sanctuary cities and states&rdquo; [9].</p>]]></description>

<h3 id="11-trumps-first-100-days-and-approval-ratings">1.1 Trump&rsquo;s First 100 Days and Approval Ratings</h3>
<p>As President Trump&rsquo;s administration reaches its first 100 days, polling data indicates historically low approval ratings. CNN reports Trump&rsquo;s approval is lower than any president in at least seven decades [1]. The Washington Post notes Trump&rsquo;s approval is sinking as Americans criticize his major policies [2]. Even among Republicans, support is limited, with only about half saying Trump has focused on the right priorities [3]. The New Yorker has characterized this period as &ldquo;One Hundred Days of Ineptitude&rdquo; [4], while the administration is actively dismissing economic concerns as the 100-day milestone approaches [5].</p>]]></description>

<p>Approximately 100 days into his second term, President Trump faces declining approval ratings below those of Biden, Obama, and Bush at comparable periods [1]. CNN documented 53 instances where Trump claimed he would end the Ukraine war within 24 hours, contradicting his recent claim these statements were &ldquo;in jest&rdquo; [2]. The president expressed reservations about whether America should be ruled &ldquo;100 percent&rdquo; by laws rather than men [3] and criticized Fox News for reporting his declining economic approval ratings [4].</p>]]></description>
