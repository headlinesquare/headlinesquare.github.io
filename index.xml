<h3 id="11-qatar-jet-controversy-and-ethics-concerns">1.1 Qatar Jet Controversy and Ethics Concerns</h3>

The proposed arrangement has raised substantial ethical concerns, with former White House ethics lawyers characterizing it as an Emoluments Clause violation [3]. Security experts describe the plane as a potential &ldquo;security nightmare&rdquo; [4], with reports indicating conversion for Air Force One use would be &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; until after 2028 and would require hundreds of millions in additional costs [5].</p>]]></description>
