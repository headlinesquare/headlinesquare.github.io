<h3 id="11-doge-department-and-elon-musks-departure">1.1 DOGE Department and Elon Musk&rsquo;s Departure</h3>
<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s departure as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has generated widespread assessment of his impact. Multiple sources indicate his tenure created substantial operational disruption across federal agencies [1][2], with some outlets characterizing his legacy in stark negative terms [3]. During his Oval Office farewell, Musk appeared sporting a black eye, attributed to &ldquo;horsing around&rdquo; with his son X [4]. Despite the formal exit, President Trump indicated Musk is &ldquo;not really leaving&rdquo; [5], with Musk stating he&rsquo;ll remain &ldquo;a friend and an adviser&rdquo; [6]. Reports allege Musk used ketamine and carried a &ldquo;box of pills&rdquo; during his tenure [7], while DOGE policy impacts remain controversial, with reports claiming USAid cuts have been &ldquo;blamed for 300,000 deaths â€” most of them children&rdquo; [8].</p>]]></description>
