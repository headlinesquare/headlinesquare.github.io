<h3 id="11-presidential-power-expansion">1.1 Presidential Power Expansion</h3>
<p>President Trump has made statements raising fundamental questions about constitutional authority. When asked if he must uphold constitutional due process, Trump reportedly said &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; [1]. Despite these concerns, he has explicitly stated he won&rsquo;t seek a third term, saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be an eight-year president&rdquo; [2]. Senior adviser Stephen Miller has presented what critics describe as a &ldquo;totally made up definition&rdquo; of constitutional due process protections [3].</p>]]></description>

<h3 id="11-executive-orders-and-policy-directives">1.1 Executive Orders and Policy Directives</h3>
<p>President Trump has issued several significant executive orders, focusing on scientific research restrictions and facility repurposing. The administration banned federal funding for &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; gain-of-function research through an executive order prohibiting both current and future funding [1][2]. Another major directive involves reopening the former federal prison at Alcatraz [3], which legal experts indicate will face significant legal challenges despite being within presidential authority. Economic protectionism measures include a 100% tariff on all foreign-produced movies [4].</p>]]></description>

<h3 id="11-constitutional-statements-and-powers">1.1 Constitutional Statements and Powers</h3>
<p>President Trump has raised significant constitutional concerns through recent statements. When directly asked if he is required to uphold the Constitution, Trump responded, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; [1]. This statement has been consistently reported across ideological lines. Similarly, Trump told Reuters he is &ldquo;unsure whether people in the US are entitled to due process&rdquo; [2]. The New York Times reports that intellectual foundations are &ldquo;setting the stage for Trump the All-Powerful&rdquo; [3], while analysts suggest his next 100 days will make his already consequential first 100 days &ldquo;look tranquil&rdquo; [4].</p>]]></description>

<h3 id="11-executive-orders-and-doge">1.1: Executive Orders and DOGE</h3>
<p>The Trump administration is implementing bureaucratic reforms, with the OMB director confirming efforts to defund what they characterize as &ldquo;woke and weaponized&rdquo; bureaucracy from the Biden era. The Department of Government Efficiency under Elon Musk is showing early impact, with recent jobs reports cited as evidence of positive results. Musk has affirmed his commitment to DOGE and support for President Trump, stating both are &ldquo;essential&rdquo; for America to &ldquo;reach greater heights&rdquo;. When questioned about potential regrets, Musk responded definitively that he has none, adding &ldquo;at least I didn&rsquo;t get shot&rdquo;.</p>]]></description>

<p>President Trump has issued several significant executive orders, including terminating federal funding for NPR and PBS, entities he accused of spreading &ldquo;radical, woke propaganda disguised as news&rdquo; [1] [2]. PBS and NPR leadership have characterized this order as &ldquo;unlawful,&rdquo; asserting the president lacks authority to defund these organizations [3]. Trump has also stated he will revoke Harvard University&rsquo;s tax-exempt status [4] and has proposed renaming Veterans Day to &ldquo;Victory Day for World War I&rdquo; [5]. The administration is implementing changes through the energy department to expand drilling in the Gulf of Mexico [6].
