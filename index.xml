<h3 id="11-presidential-authority-and-rhetoric">1.1 Presidential Authority and Rhetoric</h3>
<p>President Trump has made expansive claims about his authority, stating in an Atlantic interview, &ldquo;I run the country and the world&rdquo; [1] [2]. This assertion comes amid declining poll numbers showing his approval rating slipping to 41% after nearly 100 days [3], prompting him to &ldquo;lash out against &lsquo;fake polls&rsquo;&rdquo; [4] and reportedly demand investigations into unfavorable polling data [5]. During Vatican talks with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, Trump described him as &ldquo;calmer&rdquo; [6] and later suggested he believes Zelenskyy may be willing to cede Crimea to Russia [7]. Presidential directives now include plans to sign executive orders mandating truckers speak English [8] and requiring creation of a &ldquo;nationwide list of sanctuary cities and states&rdquo; [9].</p>]]></description>

<h3 id="11-trumps-first-100-days-and-approval-ratings">1.1 Trump&rsquo;s First 100 Days and Approval Ratings</h3>
<p>As President Trump&rsquo;s administration reaches its first 100 days, polling data indicates historically low approval ratings. CNN reports Trump&rsquo;s approval is lower than any president in at least seven decades [1]. The Washington Post notes Trump&rsquo;s approval is sinking as Americans criticize his major policies [2]. Even among Republicans, support is limited, with only about half saying Trump has focused on the right priorities [3]. The New Yorker has characterized this period as &ldquo;One Hundred Days of Ineptitude&rdquo; [4], while the administration is actively dismissing economic concerns as the 100-day milestone approaches [5].</p>]]></description>

CNN documented 53 instances where Trump claimed he would end the Ukraine war within 24 hours, contradicting his recent claim these statements were &ldquo;in jest&rdquo; [2]. The president expressed reservations about whether America should be ruled &ldquo;100 percent&rdquo; by laws rather than men [3] and criticized Fox News for reporting his declining economic approval ratings [4].</p>]]></description>
