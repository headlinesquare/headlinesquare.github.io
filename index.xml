<p>President Trump&rsquo;s birthright citizenship ban has created a challenge that could force the Supreme Court to reconsider nationwide injunctions [1].

The administration has established a 30-day deadline for pharmaceutical companies to comply [4]. Trump has directly challenged the pharmaceutical industry with this action, with some characterizing it as &ldquo;going to war with Pharma&rdquo; to ensure the country is &ldquo;treated fairly&rdquo; [5]. The Washington Post reportedly praised a Trump HHS report on pediatric surgeries, acknowledging it makes &ldquo;a strong case for caution&rdquo; regarding certain procedures [6].</p>]]></description>
