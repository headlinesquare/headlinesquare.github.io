<h3 id="11-presidential-powers-and-court-rulings">1.1 Presidential Powers and Court Rulings</h3>
<p>The Supreme Court has dramatically expanded presidential authority by granting President Trump&rsquo;s request to fire independent agency members, while explicitly exempting the Federal Reserve and Chairman Jerome Powell [1]. Justice Kagan issued a dissent condemning the elevation of &ldquo;President over our precedent&rdquo; [2]. This ruling is described by critics as &ldquo;killing the independent agency&rdquo; [3]. Chief Justice Roberts has separately stayed a lower court order that would have required DOGE to surrender documents to a watchdog organization [4].</p>]]></description>

<h3 id="11-bill-passage-and-congressional-process">1.1 Bill Passage and Congressional Process</h3>
<p>The House of Representatives narrowly passed President Trump&rsquo;s sweeping domestic policy package, officially titled the &ldquo;One Big Beautiful Bill Act&rdquo; (H.R.1) [1], after an overnight marathon session [2]. The legislation passed by a single vote [3], with Republicans securing key holdout votes including Rep. Chip Roy [4]. The vote was notably dramatic – at least one Republican representative missed the crucial vote because he fell asleep [5]. The bill now advances to the Senate where GOP leadership is working to avoid a potential revolt [6], particularly regarding the Medicaid provisions.</p>]]></description>

Attorney General Bondi&rsquo;s Justice Department has dismissed lawsuits against police departments initiated by the previous administration [4], signaling a change in federal oversight of law enforcement. Vice President Vance has publicly defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act while criticizing judicial intervention in immigration enforcement [5].

Following a two-hour conversation with Russian President Putin, Trump failed to secure a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire [6] and subsequently characterized the Ukraine conflict as &ldquo;not my problem&rdquo; [7].</p>]]></description>
