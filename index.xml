<h3 id="11-doge-and-administrative-reform">1.1 DOGE And Administrative Reform</h3>
<p>Elon Musk will &ldquo;significantly&rdquo; reduce his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) starting next month [1].

<h3 id="11-department-of-government-efficiency-doge-operations">1.1 Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Operations</h3>
<p>Elon Musk&rsquo;s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) continues expanding its authority, having secured access to sensitive Justice Department immigration data concerning millions of immigrants [1] [2] and gained control over national parks [3]. However, Musk announced plans to &ldquo;pull back significantly&rdquo; from DOGE responsibilities in May, specifically citing &ldquo;Tesla blowback&rdquo; [4] [5]. This withdrawal coincides with Tesla reporting a 71% profit drop [6], suggesting conflict between Musk&rsquo;s governmental and corporate roles. Questions persist about whether DOGE is achieving its stated purpose of significant cost reduction [7], while GOP Representative Byron Donalds faced &ldquo;shouting and critical questions&rdquo; about DOGE operations at a contentious town hall [8].</p>]]></description>

These changes align with the broader efficiency agenda driven by the Department of Government Efficiency under Elon Musk&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
<p>In a military personnel incident, Army commander Col. Sheyla Baez Ramirez was suspended after photos of President Trump, Defense Secretary Vance, and VA Secretary Hegseth disappeared from a command board [3][4]. The President has maintained public appearances, participating in the White House Easter Egg Roll where he joked that the Easter Bunny was &ldquo;not taking Trump out&rdquo; [5], while his EPA Chief confronted media outlets during a press conference characterized as &ldquo;fiery&rdquo; [6].</p>]]></description>
